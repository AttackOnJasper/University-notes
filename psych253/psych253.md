# PSYCH 253 Social Psychology

## Module 10 Social Comparison Theory
### Schachter's fear and affiliation studies
- Thesis: fear is not an internal state; it's how we relate to other people
- Basic idea: fear is shaped through social comparison
- Independent variable: warm doctor vs cold doctor

**Social Comparison Theory**: when u want to understand, u look at how others respond

### Two Factor Theory of Emotion
- Social comparison helps us understand emotion
- Brain get aroused -> compare how others label -> label those arousals as specific emotions
- Study 1: Euphoria
	- Conditions: Tell participants that pinephrine will make u feel 1. nothing (igorant) 2. calm (misinformed) 3. happy (informed)
	- All groups wait together with a hyper person
	- Result:
		- No social comparison is done in informed group (everyone treats happyness as expected side effect of vitamin)
		- Misinformed / ignorant group report feeling happier
	- Conclusion: people feel happier when they have arousal they cannot explain
- Study 2: Anger
	- Keep same conditions as the last one; the only difference is that the confederate is angry.
- Review: 
	- When people are aroused and cannot explain it, they look at other people
	- An example of interaction of person & situation
	- Perceiver shapes reality

### Bridge Study (Dutton and Aron)
- Situation: attrative women approach men in either parking lots or the middle of the bridge, ask them questions, and give them phone numbers. 
- Questions: How many call backs are there?
- Result: bridge: 50% call backs; parking lot: 10% call backs

### How to make social comparison?
- Mirror others facial expressions to learn emotions & make social comparison
- Study 1 (James-Laird): let participants move parts of faces -> form smiles -> lead better moods
- Study 2 (Strack): hold pen with teeth -> good mood; hold pen with lips -> bad mood （近朱者赤）

### Early Roots of Social Comparison Theory
- Bennington Study (Newcomb, 1947): 
	- Conducted in Bennington college: conservative, rich, girl school
	- Reference group: how and when students change their attitudes (positive / negative)
- Schachter study, 1950
	- Confederate opposes the decision made by a group, then group exerts pressure on deviant to bring them in line
- Festinger study, 1954
	- Learn measure of attitude & ability by comparing with similar others
	- **Unidirectional push upwards**: compare with others who is slightly better （跟jeff打乒乓球）

### Up / down social comparison
- Brickman and Bulman
- Wood, Taylor, and Lichtman (Breast cancer)
- Lockwood and Kunda 1997: 
	- Attainability is very important in social comparison: 
		- upward -> attainability is inspring; unattainability is demoralizing

## Module 11 Cognitive Dissonance Theory and Attitudes
### Cognitive Dissonance Theory （自我安慰）
- Example: why people keep smoking even they know it's bad
- Idea: cognitive dissonance is aroused whenever someone holds 2 cognitions that are psychologically inconsistent
	- How to resolve? Resolve it in the easiest way (try to rationalize their attitudes towards their behaviors)
- Study 1 (Festinger & Schachter):
	- The only participant observation study in social psychology
	- Prophecy Fail: failed prophecy for 1956 leads to conflicting cognitions of the group that believes the prophecy
	- The group eventually thinks cult saved the world & becomes more committed to the cult 
- Study 2 (Brehm): Free Choice Paradigm
	- People re-rate their choices higher than their rating at the first time
	- Conflict: bad features of people's choice
- Insufficient Justification (Festinger & Carlsmith):
	- People change their attitudes to be consistent with their behaviors
	- e.g. Get $1 to lie about liking something instead of $20 makes people like that thing more (Justify their behavior)
	- e.g. Go to Amazon with lower salary
- Forced Compliance Theory: people will not change their attitude to match their behavior that they are forced to do (they think that they are forced to do, so they don't have dissonace)
	- High choice: a trick that lets participants think that they have many choices
	- Low choice: force participants to do something
- Effort Justification (Aronson & Mills, 1960s)
	- Let women talk about sex in a group
	- Mild initiation condition (read a list of words) vs. severe initiation condition (read to male experimenter)
	- Severe condition: women suffer reading in front -> try to justify their behavior -> think that the group is more fun

### Self-perception theory
- Daryl Bem
	- believed cognitive dissonance is wrong; instead, people watch their behaviors & infer their attitudes by watching
	- replicate the experiments & let observers to explain participants' behaviors
- Overjustification effect (Lepper, Green, and Nisbett)
	- have expected rewards: people think u doing it for external motiviation rather than internal motivation
	- study: Children and Magic marker
		- no reward condition / unexpected reward condition: observer would say children like markers
		- expected reward condition: observer would say children play markers for rewards

### Important difference: Self-perception - no arousal; Cognitive dissonance - arousal due to conflict
- How to check if aroused?
	- Dissonance and pill study (Zanna & Cooper 1974)
		- nervous pill group -> attribute dissonance to pill -> no attitude change
		- hidden effect pill group -> attitude change a little
		- calm pill group -> attitude change a lot to resolve dissonance
		- showed that arousal level matters -> cognitive dissonance is right
	- Fazio, Zanna, Cooper 1977
		- get an integration of 2 theories
		- latitude of acceptance: e.g. 10% tuition increase or 3% tuition increase
		- no arousal within latitude of acceptance (self-perception), and vice versa
		- most attitude change when high choice & no booth (no explanation / reward)

### Self and Dissonance
- Self-affirmation theory
	- Self concept is threatened -> need to change the attitude to remove the threat
	- Self identity can buffer from self-threat
		- White coat scientists study (Steele, Hopp and Gonzales)
	- Self-threat has different effects on people with differnt self-esteem
		- CD rating study: people with low self-esteem shows more dissonance
		- only get dissonance when there might be negative consequences

### Attitude Behavior Consistency
- Attitudes not always predict behaviors (e.g. trump建长城)
- Strong situational pressure -> attitudes follow behavior
	- Foot-in-the-door phenomenon (car sign)
	- Low-ball technique (raise price)
- Weak situational pressure / strong person factor -> attitudes predict behavior
