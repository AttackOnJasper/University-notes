# PSYCH 253 Social Psychology
- the scientific study of how people think about, influence, and relate to one another

## Module 1 History
- Social Psychology Founder: Kurt Lewin (Germany -> U.S.)
- Gestalt psychology: the perception of objects
	- Lewin applied this to try to understand the perception of people
- 3 parts of behavior (situation, perceiver, interaction)



## Module 2 Research Methods
- Try to revise theories over and over
- To infer causation: 
	- correlation
		- independent vars: control / experimental groups
		- dependent vars: measures
			- reliable (precise): get consistent results over and over again
			- valid (accuracy): measure what it is supposed to measure
	- time order 
	- eliminate other possible causes 
		- random assignment to each group
		- procedural control (keep process of groups as similar as possible)
- Surveys
	- random sampling == random selection: everyone has the same chance to be selected (so that small group can represent the whole group)
	- unbiased questions
		- Anchoring effects: pushing people in 1 direction
		- Framing effects: framing questions to seem like there is only one answer
- The ethics of experimentation
	- mundane realism: Degree to which an experiment is superficially similar to everyday situations.
		- a type of external validaty
	- experimental realism: Degree to which an experiment absorbs and involves its participants
		- should engage the participants
	- demand characteristics: Cues in an experiment that tell the participant what behavior is expected
		- To reduce this effect, experimenter standardize their instructions e.g. video taping



## Module 3 Conformity: A change in behavior or belief to accord with others e.g. sprint planning (how and why people do that?)
- Subsets: compliance, obedience, acceptance
- The Sherif Study (1935)
	- Steady light in dark room -> think it's moving due to autokinetic phenomenon -> cannot tell if it's moving by comparing surrounding -> people come to agree how far it's moved over several days
	- Transmission of beliefs: 5 generations (Jacobs and Campbell, 1961)
	- **Informational influence** value others ideas
- Asch 'comparing lines' Study: would one agrees something wrong but other people saying it's right? (try to find out why people follow Hilter)
	- ask to take part in a study of perceptual judgments
	- unambigous stimuli; 7 confederates say opposite
	- 37% subjects gave the wrong answer; 70% subjects gave wrong answer at least once
	- **Normative influence** Conformity based on a person’s desire to fulfill others’ expectations, often to gain acceptance
		- go along by external pressure when people do not agree


## Module 4 Helpness
### Why one would help
- The good samaritan study
	- conditions: early / late / on time for an appointment & meet a person needs help half way
	- situation influences whether people would help
- Smoke-filled Room Study (Latine Daley): would help only if perceive the incident as an emergency
- Lady in Distress Study
	- A lady cries in the middle of way for help under conditions: alone / with stranger / confederate / friend
	- **Pluralistic ignorance** A false impression of what most other people are thinking or feeling, or how they are responding.
		- a majority of group members privately reject a norm, but incorrectly assume that most others accept it, and therefore go along with it
		- in this case, it's difficult to read strangers' responses -> hard to determine if it's emergency because other people have no behavior / signs (do not want to look like a fool - audience inhibition)
- Seizure Study
	- One would help if he / she is responsible
	- **Diffusion of responsibility** occurs when there r multiple people
		- reduced if less people & less psychological distance
- Decision Tree to help: notice the incident -> treat as emergency -> think I m responsible -> help
- Audience inhibition: embarrassed or worried about how other observers will view them

### Social Norms Impact
- Norm of Reciprocity
- Norm of Equity: overbenefitted should help underbenefitted
- Norm of Social Responsibility: adult help children
- Norm of Justice: help those who deserve it

### Mood Impact
- Good mood -> help more
	- Cookie Study: students received cookies -> donated more money
	- Dime in Phone Booth Study: more likely to help if call back is within 8 min
	- Why? 
		- Think helping is positive
		- Maintain the good mood
- Bad mood -> may help more (esp. guilt)
	- The lie study: lied people would feel guilty -> help more
- Empathy (Batman's model)
	- high empathy -> try to reduce others' distress -> switch off electric shock on someone else
	- low empathy & watched others suffer from shock -> try to reduce own distress -> switch off



## Module 5 Aggression (Physical or verbal behavior intended to hurt someone)
- Heat & aggression are weakly correlated

### Frustration & aggression
- Frustration-aggression theory: frustration always leads to aggression
	- Study (Dollard, Doob, Miller) - aggression to the agent that blocks the goal; if cannot reach then displaced
	- Frustrates when goal is blocked. e.g. American South -> if cotton production is low -> more slaves die
- Revision: frustration -> anger -> aggression
	- Aggressive cues
		- weapons effect studies (presence of weapons)
		- Black uniform (sports team)

### Modeling & aggression
- Bobo Doll Study: children watch people beating dolls -> beat dolls many times when they play with it
- TV -> aggression
	- make people immune to aggression (adaptive to aggression)
	- easy to imitate aggression (Bandura study)
	- tend to commit violence (porn)
		- justify more on rape
		- Sexual promiscuity & hostile masculinity -> Coerciveness to women
- ways that prolonged viewing of violence in media can change how we think
	- develop violent **social scripts** (Culturally provided mental instructions for how to act in various situations.)
	- desensitization: adaptation e.g. 公开讨论性话题
	- altered perceptions of reality (e.g. think world is scary)
	- cognitive priming: think with more aggressive ideas



## Module 6 Self
- Self-reference effect (think about how something relates to self; memory)

### Self-schemas (Hazel Markus)
- **Beliefs about self that organize and guide the processing of self-relevant information.**
- influence thinking speed (self-schema of an aspect -> process that info more quickly)
- Working self-concept: a subset of self-schemas used at a particular time
- Study (Markus and Kunda)
	- answer questions with confederates
	- too many differences -> tend to activate 'similarity' schema -> say 'me' quickly
	- too many similarities -> tend to activate 'dissimilar' schema -> say 'not me' quickly
- Possible selves (hope / expect / fear to be)

### Self concepts formation ('who am I?') Self concept = self schema + possible selves
- by other people's perception (Cooley and Mead)
- by introspections (bad)
	- Nibett and Wilson Studies: have little understanding of our inside
		- Tide detergent: words subjects tried to recall affected the brand they came up
		- Ratings of cold / warm prof
		- Affective forecasting
- affected by social context: want to describe self as standing out from rest
- Social Comparison Theory
	- gain self concepts by comparing with others / with ourselves in the past
		- distort memory to derogate self & feel better (self-serving bias)
		- University freshman study (Wilson and Ross)

### Self-serving bias (tendency to perceive self favorably)
- **False Consensus** tendency to overestimate commonality of one's opinions
- **False uniqueness** think that few others behave or think like u
- Unrealistic optimism e.g. I will pass this even if pass rate is 5%
- **Group-serving bias** Overestimation of contributions and abilities: think contribute more than rest of team
	- Ross and Sicoly
- **Self-serving attribution** explanations of success / failure: internal / external attribution e.g. 篮球赛输赢
- Basking in reflected glory: we win; they lose
	- Study: feedback & badges
- Self-handicapping (找理由) produce excuses in case if bad performance e.g. exam & drinking / excuse for a bad test
	- try to prevent self from getting hurt (self-serving bias)

### Why do we have self-serving bias
- **self-affirmation theory** maintain positive self-image
	- theory that (a) people often experience a self-image threat, after engaging in an undesirable behavior; and (b) they can compensate by affirming another aspect of the self. Threaten people’s self-concept in one domain, and they will compensate either by refocusing or by doing good deeds in some other domain.
- **self-evaluation maintenance theory** maintain self-esteem (sense of self-worth)
	- Ways to maintain
		- change distance from others
		- change how important something is to us e.g. score is not important if fail the exam
		- change our perception of how well we did

### Self-presentation (express oneself in a favorable way e.g. 装逼)
- Self monitoring: high / low self-monitors 分场合表现自己
- Self verification: present to maintain self-views (even negative views) 让人看真实一面



## Module 7 - Attribution and Person Perception
- **Attribution Theory** The theory of how people explain others’ behavior e.g. internal dispositions (enduring traits, motives, attitudes) or to external situations
- dispositional / situational attribution

### Person perception
- Asch's Gestalt Model of Person Perception
	- Study: perceive people from a list of descriptive sentences
		- perception depends on order of words / words with strong meanings / context of other words
### Perceiving Non-Verbal Behaviour
- Facial expressions
- Body language

### Heider Phenomenological Model
- how do we attribute what type of a person someone is from their behaviors
	- investigate people's general tendencies
- Brunswick Lens Model
	- attribution of causality (person / situation) e.g. worker's fault or workplace's fault?
	- attribution of responsibility (intention / foreknowledge)

### Two Classic Theories of Attribution
- Jones and Davis' Correspondent Inference Theory
	- **Correspondent Inference** behavior reflects traits & types of person
	- **spontaneous trait inference** An automatic inference of a trait after exposure to someone’s behavior
	- Factors affecting whether correspondent inference is applicable
		- if people choose / are forced to do something
		- whether a behavior is expected
		- noncommon cause / effect e.g. 为party去某个大学
- Kelley's Covariation Model
	- Covariation principle: multiple people engage in same behavior
	- Figure out the cause of behavior (internal / external)
	- 3 kinds of information
		- Consistency: How consistent is the person’s behavior in this situation
			- not consistent -> little attribution can be made
		- Consensus: To what extent do others in this situation behave similarly
			- high -> external; low (i.e. different from other people) -> internal
		- Distinctiveness: How specific is the person’s behavior to this particular situation
			- it can be external or internal; need to be combined with other information	

### How Do We Make Attributions
- Fundamental attribution error
	- tend to think of people’s actions are due to who they are rather than the situation
	- Study (Jones and Harris 1967): Castro speech
		- People attributed speech attitudes to speechwriters' even if speechwriters are assigned to write the speech
	- Study (Ross, Amabile, and Steinmetz)
		- everyone (contestatns & observers) thought questioners (subjects who gave questions) were smarter
- The actor observer bias
	- attribute more causes to situation for ourselves (self serving)
	- make situational attributions in first person point of view
	- make fundamental attribution error when they are self-aware (look at themselves from third person point of view)
- Two step model of attribution (Gilbert) person attribution then corrected based on situation

### Schemas (guide our processing of information; context)
- e.g. instructions to wash clothes
- e.g. flipping cards with / without schemas -> accuracy varies a lot
- 2 Heuristics (Daniel Kahneman, Amos Tversky): guide processing of information / thinking strategy that enables quick, efficient judgments.
	- **Representativeness Heuristic** The tendency to presume, sometimes despite contrary odds, that someone or something belongs to a particular group if resembling (representing) a typical member.
		- e.g. Linda sounds like a feminist (has all traits of a typical feminist)
	- Availability Heuristic
		- availability of something influences how likely we think it is
		- e.g. # of k(.)+ vs # of ..k(.)+
		- e.g. 美国不安全 (一直只报道枪击案)
- guide reconstruction of memory
	- Study: bring a schema to ask people who just see the car accident  -> recall the speed of vehicle during accident a lot faster



## Module 08 - Stereotyping and Prejudice
### Motivational Theories of Prejudice
- Realistic Conflict Theory (Sherif)
	- Sherif's Robber's Cave Experiment
		- Ran summer camp & divide 2 groups to compete over scarce resources
		- Superordinate goal that can only be achieved by 2 groups together helps repair the intergroup relations
- Social Identity Theory
  	- **Any distiction** between groups causes favoritism for own group
	- Minimal Group Experiment: 
		- Study 1: divided based on trivial difference -> gave more points to own group
		- Study 2: divided based on preference for abstract art -> still had favorism
	- Spencer's Minimal Group Study: students from UMichigan & from Ohio State
- Prejudice and Self-Image Maintenance
	- Better group & social identity -> better self identity -> feels better
	- Study (Fein and Spencer) Jewish American Princess
		- Got negative feedback on IQ test -> Low self-esteem -> think Jewish did much worse in workplace than Italian (to increase self-esteem)

### Cognitive Theories of Stereotyping
- Too much complexity in world -> form schema to simplify -> categorize people
- How Do Stereotypes Form?
	- Out-group Homogeneity Effect 黑人长得都差不多
	- **Illusory Correlations** Perception of a relationship / correlation where none exists (esp. in minorities) e.g. 认为阿三都很坑
		- Rare things got overemphasized in memory (esp. undesired behaviors)
- How Are Stereotypes Perpetuated (保持)?
	- Cognitive theory accounts for this
	- Study (Esses and Zanna, 1995) Mood and Stereotype
		- Bad mood -> distinctive traits become more negative

### The Changing Face of Stereotyping
- Survey Findings - Past and Present
	- Princeton Trilogy Study (1933, 1950, 1972)
		- ask people to assign personality traits to 20 racial groups
		- Overt stereotypes -> subtle forms e.g. 有黑人邻居就搬家
- Subtler Forms of Prejudice - Earlier Studies
	- Pencil Poking study (Sagar and Schofield) when black children is poking with pencil, all other children see him as trying to hurt the other instead of getting attention
	- Aversive racism: people would not make overt prejudice comments
		- persistent avoidance of interaction with other racial and ethnic groups
	- Helping study: offer more help to black & ask less help from black
	- Inadmissable Evidence Study: 
		- has inadmissable evidence that shows defendant is innocent
		- white defendant -> people wanna prove he/she is innocent -> ignore judge & consider inadmissable evidence
		- black defendant -> ignore the evidence -> still guilty
- Subtler Forms of Prejudice - Recent Studies
	- The Amadou Diallo Story
	- Correll, Park, and Judd (2003) in video game, more likely to shoot black people
- Implicit and Explicit Stereotyping
	- Implicit stereotyping: occur outside our awareness
	- Study (Spencer, Fein, Wolfe, Fong, 1998): word completion task; more negative words given black faces flashed + negative feedback on an IQ test
	- Study (Sinclair & Kunda, 1999) rating for interview is very bad if a black interviewer gave negative feedback
		- 2nd study: change black interviewer to black doctor
			- if positive feedback, doctor stereotype is activated
			- if negative feedback, black stereotype is activated
			- motives & desires affect stereotyping
- Changing Prejudice and Stereotyping
	- Segregation was changed by 'Brown vs Board of Education' 1954
	- Contact Hypothesis
		- school desegregation, interaction, work together towards goal would help reduce stereotypes
		- may increase subtle / aversive racism
		- Friendships & Laws may decrease subtle racism



## Module 09 - Persuasion
- definition: The process by which a message induces change in beliefs, attitudes, or behaviors.

### The Early Years: Yale prof in WWII; try to boost soldier morale
- Classic Persuasion Variables

### Two Models of Transferring Persuasive Messages
- Controlled and Heuristic processing (Chaiken & Eagley)
	- controlled processing: think about the image
	- heuristic processing: think without thinking
- Elaboration Likelihood Model (Petty & Caciopo)
	- Central Route (thoughts): analytical, high effort, arguments
		- motivated to think due to the content / argument of message
	- Peripheral Route (subconscious): focus on cues that trigger automatic acceptance

### The Communicator
- Credibility (usually peripheral)
	- Expertise (central) e.g. T.S. Eliot changed more people's opinions about bad poems than a local paper writer
	- **Trustworthiness** Persuaded by people who we trust even if they have no expertise 妈妈让尝试一个东西
	- **Sleeper Effect** delayed persuasion 慢慢洗脑 
	 	- To have the effect, argument needs to be more memorable than the source (i.e. remember the content but forget who said it)
		- e.g. Oppenheimer (expert) vs. Pravda (local paper)
			- initially, most people must expert
			- with reminder of the source, not much attitude change
			- withou reminder, most people believe Pravda the same amount as Oppoenheimer over 4 weeks
- Attractiveness - Study: attractive / unattractive women ask to sign petition
- Similarity 

### The Message
- The Central Route to persuasion
	- If message has large discrepancy & want it to be persuasive, then the argument better be good
		- Study: Ohio State students need to pass a 3-day comprehensive exam
			- high involvement people's attitudes largely depends on the arguments of the message
	- 2-sided appeals > 1-side appeal when processed centrally 
		- Study: Yale school - strength of Japanese Army 1944; 2-sided speech
			- People who initially disagree the large strength of army think more centrally; have stronger argument
			- Result: 2-sided arguments work well on central route
	- argument strength: 质量大于数量
- The Peripheral Route to persuasion 无意识洗脑 e.g. TV ads
	- Emotions / mood
		- Good mood e.g. eating -> good mood -> easy to be persuaded
		- Fear: more persuasive when giving the remedy of that fear
	- Number of Arguments 数量大于质量
	- One-Sided Arguments
	- Primacy and Recency (availability heuristic)

### The Audience
- **Attitude inoculation** Exposing people to weak attacks upon their attitudes so that when stronger attacks come, they will have refutations / defenses available.
- Allow audience to process info through central route
	- Being forewarned e.g. told there would be a speech about the opinion that u disagree
	- Being involved
	- Having a high need for cognition

### Is Attitude Change So Easy? No!
- easy to change the unimportant ones
- may change important ones given the arguments are good & central route



## Module 10 Social Comparison Theory 
- idea: when u want to understand, u look at how others respond
- **Social Comparison** Evaluating one’s abilities and opinions by comparing oneself with others.

### Schachter's fear and affiliation studies
- Thesis: fear is not an internal state; it's how we relate to other people
- Basic idea: fear is shaped through social comparison
- Independent variable: low fear vs. high fear
- Result: people stay together under fear -> want to understand what would happen

### Two Factor Theory of Emotion (Schachter and Singer, 1962) arousal * its label = emotion
- Social comparison helps us understand emotion: Brain get aroused ->  understand arousal by comparing how others label -> label those arousals as specific emotions
- Study 1: Euphoria
	- Conditions: Tell subjects that pinephrine would feel nothing (igorant) / calm (misinformed) / happy (informed)
	- All groups wait together with a hyper person
	- Result:
		- No social comparison is done in informed group (treats happyness as expected side effect of vitamin)
		- Misinformed / ignorant group report feeling happier
	- Conclusion: people feel happier when they have arousal they cannot explain
- Study 2: Anger - Keep same conditions as above; the only difference is that the confederate is angry
	- informed group: not angry at all (attribute anger to side effect of drug)
	- ignorant group: very angry (cannot explain why they are angry)
- Review: 
	- When people are aroused and cannot explain it, they look at other people & take other people's reations
	- An example of interaction of person & situation; perceiver shapes reality

### Bridge Study (Dutton and Aron)
- Situation: attrative women approach men in either parking lots or the middle of the bridge, ask them questions, and give them phone numbers. 
- Result: bridge: 50% call backs; parking lot: 10% call backs
- Physical arousal accentuates romantic responses

### How to make social comparison?
- Mirror others facial expressions to learn emotions & make social comparison
- Study 1 (James-Laird): let participants move parts of faces -> form smiles -> lead better moods
- Study 2 (Strack): hold pen with teeth -> good mood; hold pen with lips -> bad mood （facial expression affects emotion）

### Early Roots of Social Comparison Theory
- Bennington Study (Newcomb, 1947): 
	- Conducted in Bennington college: conservative, rich girls entered a free-spirited environment
	- **Reference group** is critical in how and when students change their attitudes (参照组 i.e. 跟谁比)
		- positive reference group: 我觉得和我很像的群体 e.g. 码农
			- in this study, developing friends who were liberal changed their views quickly
		- negative reference group: 我觉得和我不像的群体 e.g. 富二代
			- in this study, feeling they are not like the people back home made them more liberal as well
- Schachter study, 1950: Confederate opposes the decision made by a group, then group exerts pressure on deviant to bring them in line
- Festinger study, 1954
	- Learn measure of attitude & ability by comparing with similar others
	- **Unidirectional push upwards**: people want to compare with others who is slightly better （跟jeff打乒乓球）

### Up / down social comparison
- Brickman and Bulman (1977) Downward comparison often feel better, but could feel worse
- Wood, Taylor, and Lichtman (Breast cancer)
	- People usually make downward comparison on dimensions where they would not be going to
- Lockwood and Kunda 1997: 
	- Attainability is very important in social comparison: （能不能达到）
		- upward -> attainability is inspring; unattainability is demoralizing e.g. 1st year vs. 4th year 看到大神

### Relative Deprivation
- Study (Merton and Kitt, 1950) 
	- soldier in U.S. - unhappy; soldier on battlefield - unhappy; soldier in England - very happy
	- Importance of reference groups
- Study (Brickman, Coates, and Janoff-Bulman)
	- 1 Lottery winners: happy for 3 weeks
	- 2 Paraplegics: people who became paralyzed for 4 months are as happy as normal people



## Module 11 Cognitive Dissonance Theory and Attitudes
### Cognitive Dissonance Theory （自我安慰）
- Example: why people keep smoking even they know it's bad
- Idea: **cognitive dissonance is aroused whenever someone holds 2 cognitions that are psychologically inconsistent** i.e. behaviors & attitudes do not go along -> aroused
	- How to resolve? Resolve it in the easiest way (try to rationalize their attitudes to go along with their behaviors)
- Study 1 (Festinger & Schachter):
	- The only participant observation study in social psychology
	- Prophecy Fail: failed prophecy for 1956 lead to conflicting cognitions of the group that believed the prophecy
		- try to seek explanation about why prophecy failed
	- The group eventually rationalized cult saved the world & became more committed to the cult 
- Study 2 (Brehm): Free Choice Paradigm
	- People re-rate their choices higher than their rating before choosing that choice
	- Tried to rationalize their behaviors from the conflict arised by the bad features of people's choice
- Insufficient Justification (Festinger & Carlsmith)
	- People change their attitudes to be consistent with their behaviors
	- Involved in a boring task, then get paid & ask to lie to the next people that the task is fun
	- Subjects who get $1 to lie instead of $20 like that task more (Justify their behavior)
		- $1 is not a good reason for lying -> dissonance -> resolve by changing beliefs
	- e.g. Go to Amazon with lower salary -> 可以回加拿大
- **Forced Compliance Theory** people will not change their attitude to match their behavior that they are forced to do (they think that they are forced to do, so they don't have dissonace)
	- High choice: a trick that lets participants think that they have many choices
		- **Locus of control** The extent to which people perceive outcomes as internally controllable by their own efforts or as externally controlled by chance or outside forces
	- Low choice: force participants to do something
- Effort Justification (Aronson & Mills, 1960s)
	- Let women talk about sex in a group
	- Mild initiation condition (read a list of words) vs. severe initiation condition (read to a male experimenter)
	- The group turned out to be grasshopper mating discussion group -> very boring -> mild condition subjects hated it
	- Severe condition result: women suffer reading in front -> try to justify their behavior -> think that the group is fun

### Self-perception theory
- Daryl Bem
	- believed cognitive dissonance is wrong; instead, people watch their behaviors & infer their attitudes by watching
	- replicate the experiments & let observers to explain participants' behaviors
- Overjustification effect (Lepper, Green, and Nisbett)
	- have expected rewards: people think u doing it for external motiviation rather than internal motivation
	- study: Children and Magic marker
		- no reward condition / unexpected reward condition: observer would say children like markers
		- expected reward condition: observer would say children play markers for rewards

### Important difference: Self-perception - no arousal; Cognitive dissonance - arousal due to conflict
- How to check if aroused?
	- Dissonance and pill study (Zanna & Cooper 1974)
		- arousal differ in high choice group (perceived / illsory control)
		- nervous pill group -> attribute dissonance to pill -> no attitude change
		- hidden effect pill group -> attitude change a little
		- calm pill group -> attitude change a lot to resolve dissonance
		- showed that arousal level matters -> cognitive dissonance is right
	- Fazio, Zanna, Cooper 1977: try to get an **integration of 2 theories**
		- **latitude of acceptance** (临界点) e.g. 10% tuition increase or 3% tuition increase
		- no arousal within latitude of acceptance (self-perception), and vice versa
		- most attitude change when high choice & no booth (no explanation / reward)

### Self and Dissonance
- Self concept is threatened -> dissonance -> need to change the attitude to remove the threat
- Self-affirmation & dissonance
	- Self identity can buffer from self-threat
		- White coat scientists study (Steele, Hopp and Gonzales)
- Self-threat has different effects on people with different self-esteem
	- CD rating study: people with low self-esteem shows more dissonance
	- only get dissonance when there might be negative consequences

### Attitude Behavior Consistency
- Attitudes not always predict behaviors (e.g. trump建长城)
- Strong situational pressure -> attitudes follow behavior
	- Foot-in-the-door phenomenon (car sign)
	- Low-ball technique (raise price)
- Weak situational pressure / strong person factor -> attitudes predict behavior

### Theory of planned behavior
- first: Attitude toward the behavior, Subjective norms (other people's attitudes), perceived control
- second: behavior intention (e.g. I m going to start next week)
- finally: behavior



## Module 12 Self-Fulfilling Prophecies and Intergroup Relations

### Self-Fulfilling Prophecies
- **a prediction made that is initially not true, but becomes true because the prediction is made**
	- e.g. stock market: everyone thinks the market would crash -> sell all stocks -> crash
- Teacher Expectancy Effect / Rosenthal Effect / Pygmalion Effect (Rosenthal and Jacobson) teacher's expectation about how start a student is going to be actually determines how smart that student will become
- Zanna and Pack (1975)
	- Women evaluated themselves about whether they are traditional (through anagram test), then interact with attractive / not-attractive guys to find out what kind of women they like
	- Would like to investigate whether the women would change their performance on performing a task based on what the men like
	- Women would change to become more traditional / non traditional based on their desired men's expectations
- Word, Zanna, and Cooper 1974
	- Idea: racial stereotypes influence behavior
	- Let interviewer treat white guys as black guys
	- Result: white guys performed very bad (worse than black guys)

### Pieces of self-fulfilling prophecies
- **Confirmation bias**: see what u expect/ wish to see; tendency to search for info that confirms preconceptions
	- Darley & Gross 1983
		- ask watching a girl taking test & determine what kind of student she is
		- see 2 backgrounds: rich / poor (social-economic status)
		- difficult to tell how smart she is from her answers
		- Result: rich -> smart; poor -> dumb
- **Confirmatory Hypothesis Testing**: getting people to say what you expect
	- ask biased questions that people are likely to answer in ways that support your hypothesis
	- Snyder and Swann 1978 (extraverted / interverted)
		- Study 1
			- ask subjects to interview a group of people; pick 10 out of 25 biased questions
			- If people think there are more extraverts in the group, they will pick more extraverted questions
		- Study 2: Subjects who interviewed different groups of people would ask with biased questions
- **Behavioural Confirmation**: cause people to act the way you expect
	- e.g. teacher expectancy effect study
	- Snyder, Tanke, and Berscheid 1977
		- give men the fake photos of girls they talk to -> behavior changed -> use confirmatory hypothesis testing to confirm physical attractiveness stereotypes -> women act in accord with the stereotype

### Stereotypes <-> Self-fulfilling prophecies
- Stereotype creates self-fulfilling prophecies -> impair people's abilities (not always)
- Crocker and Major 1987: tested that stereotyped people **don't have low self-esteem**
- Major, Spencer, Schmader, Wolfe, and Crocker 1998
	- bias primed (i.e. notified): black won't feel bad
	- not primed: black will feel bad
	- stereotyped groups do not have low self esteem -> attribute bad performance to existing stereotypes

### Stereotypes Threat and Achievement
- Stereotypes **affect performance** and create burden on difficult tasks
- **Stereotype Threat** A disruptive concern, when facing a negative stereotype, that one will be evaluated based on a negative stereotype.
- Study (Spencer, Steele, and Quinn, 1999): Women and Math
	- women did much better upon being told there were no gender differences
- Study (Steele and Aronson 1995): Black's verbal performance drops if they think a pre-test is diagnostic
- Commercials and women's career aspirations (Davis, Spencer)
	- stereotypes affect **aspirations** - govern what careers to choose for each gender
	- women fear that others would reduce them to a negative stereotype

### Subtyping & subgrouping
- **Subtyping** Accommodating individuals who deviate from one’s stereotype by thinking them as “exceptions to the rule.”
	- e.g. Woody - 四川人不会吃辣, male scientists treat female scientists as exceptions to normal females
- **subgrouping** Accommodating individuals who deviate from one’s stereotype by forming a new stereotype about this subset of the group. 



## Module 13 Social Psychology and Health
### Health and Control
- Executive rats: People with more control (even perceived control) of bad situations are more healthy
- **Learned helplessness** hopelessness learned when perceive no control over repeated bad events
	- Study: put dogs in cage (cannot get out), move -> electric shock -> dog don't move even the cage is removed
	- **Original model** depressed people give up even when they can do something about bad things that happen to them
	- **Reformulated model** people in learned helplessness make internal, stable, and global attributions
- Control -> less learned helplessness -> less pessimism -> optimism
	- Study (Rodin and Langer): Control in nursing home (15 months life)
		- Fixed routine (food, furniture, clothes) vs. Freedom (clothes, other possessions, do whatever they want)
		- People with more control are more happy and live longer (mental & physical health)
- Importance of Value System and Meaning
	- Children Lost Study (McIntosh, Sylver, and Wortman 1992): length of recovery time of losing child
		- Make meaning of an event gives sense of control

### Health and Stress
- Selye's General Adaptation Syndrome: stress -> alarm
- Primary Appraisal for a life changing event: is it a threat or challenge?
- Daily hassle > life changing event
	- Dorms and illness study: better dorm -> less medical visit
	- Interpersonal conflict is the worst (hard to resolve - perceive as threat instead of challenge)

### Models of depression
- Pennebaker: inhibition -> stress -> inhibits finding meaning -> less control -> more inhibition (confrontation may help)
- Nolen-Hoeksma: negative mood -> self-focus -> negative mood (distraction may help)
- Seems opposite, but both ways suggest ways of controlling thoughts & looking outward

### Alcohol Myopia
- Why alcohol has different effects?
	- alcohol restricts attention & exacerbate the power of situation
	- usually act as a great distractor (less self-focus)
	- however sometimes can focus on self, making people more depressed (e.g. 周缘哭)
- Aggression
	- "The angry drunk": drunk people only know the straight way to fight back
	- Cues while drunk are more effective
- Helpness (by exacerbation of the power of situation)
	- Strong situational pressure (e.g. face-to-face request) -> drunk people more likely to help (power of situation)
- Drunk driving (situational pressure)
	- tends to agree drunk driving after drunk & situation pressure: e.g. short distance, drop off friends (restricted attention to only the situation instead of considering other things)
- Date rape (酒后乱性)
	- Power of situation: one is aroused
	- Attention is restricted to arousal, and the consequence is not considered
	- Date rape is justified while drunk

### Social Support & Health
- pros: generally good, aid treatment, help process feelings
- cons: could be annoying, may develop binge-eating

### Clinician's impact
- Interaction allows patients to develop trust on doctor, more satisfied, and better health outcome
- Study: patients stay more days in hospital if surgery is not explained



## Module 14 Law
### Eyewitness 
- Can be biased - often pick up the wrong person
- Study (biased line-up procedures): 
	- conditions: unbiased (culprit may not be here) / biased (culprit should be here) instructions, culprit in / not in the line up
	- results:
		- unbiased + culprit in: 100% correct
		- unbiased + culprit not in: 60% correct
		- biased + in: 70% correct
		- biased + not in: 20% correct
- **Misinformation effect** Incorporating “misinformation” into one’s memory of the event
- Recommendation: unbiased instructions + all features identified by witness need to be present in all people in line-up
- Questioning might distort people's memory
	- Study: Making people believe that they did something that they did not do (computer typing task)
		- conditions: instruct to type fast / slow, control / witness
		- a button to crash the computer; computer crashes; get an interview and ask them to confess 
		- people do confess and might believe they did the wrong thing
	- Central Park Jogger Case

### Jury
- How do they decide guilty or not?
	- Weigh all pros / cons
	- Try to construct a narrative from pieces of information (e.g. Kobe & women told different stories)
- Dynamics
	- Majority influence
		- two-thirds rule: 2/3 before walking in -> 100% after (Davies et al. 1975, 1977)
		- **group polarization** everyone's arguments go more extreme (e.g. disagree -> more disagree)
			- arised from group deliberation
		- reassurance
	- Minority Influence: only have impact if they are strong, consistent, forceful, self-confident
		- A minority that faviors acquittal stands a better chance
	- Leniency bias: doubt -> let the defendant off
- tend to brush off legal categories of murder

### Problems of trial
- Would Excluded Evidence affect the judgment of jury?
	- Study (Kassin & Sommers 1997): admissible excluded evidence has a huge effect
- Publicity: jurors find it hard to ignore pre-trial publicity
- Bad witnesses influence jurors as much as the good ones



## Module 15 Social Psychology and Environment
### Crowding
- Global warming
- City get crowded -> performance drops
	- Study: verbal problem solving
		- conditions: less / more people with / without perceived control (Illusion of control)
		- crowding together in a room -> performance drops
- Considers crowding if > 1 people in a room
- Violence increases with more crowding. e.g. in a prison

### Social Dilemmas (how people negotiate splitting up resources)
- Prisoner's Dilemma
	- always better off if they confess, but group effect is the worst if both confess
	- self interest vs group interest
- **Tragedy of the Commons** if everybody try to maximize self-interest -> group suffers e.g. English fishes, Canadian fishing industry, Global warming (country's benefit vs. world's benefit), 国内工厂排污
- To sacrifice the self interest & help the group, people need to see consequences, political point, other people incorporate & only for short term
- **System Justification** people have several underlying needs, which vary from individual to individual, that can be satisfied by the defense and justification of the status quo, even when the system may be disadvantageous to certain people 安于现状

### Money and Happiness
- There is a weak correlation: money buys happiness if it provides basic necessities
	- Everybody being better off does not provide happiness (e.g. inflation)
	- Happiness arised from social comparison 
	- **Adaptation-level phenomenon** Tendency to adapt to a given level of stimulation and thus to notice and react to changes from that level 永不知足
		- people take what they have for granted (less effect the money has)
	- diminishing returns



## Module 16 Social Psychology and Business
### Leadership styles (Lewin, Lipett, and White, 1930s)
- Styles: 
	- Authoritarian (order)
	- Democratic (vote)
	- Laissez Faire (do nothing) 
	- Task leadership: Leadership that organizes work, sets standards, and focuses on goals.
	- Social leadership: Leadership that builds teamwork, mediates conflict, and offers support.
	- Transformational leadership, enabled by a leader’s vision and inspiration, exerts significant influence.
	- Transactional leadership: directs a team to focus on a goal while being open to input from team members
- Measures aggression & productivity
- Democratic style is the best
- **Participatory management** productivity up when ...

### Gourp Polarization
- definition: if groups discuss something, the opinions may become more extreme
- Rishy shift: group more risky than individual
- Study (Myers and Bishop 1970)
	- People with high / low prejudice about an issue discuss 
	- after discussion high prejudice -> more opposed, low prejudice -> more supportive
- why it happens?
	- social comparison: want to look different if others have same ideas
	- more and more arguments push in directions further
	- Close-mindedness: one view shuts down other views
	- Pressures towards uniformity

### Group think 
- e.g. Bay of Pigs Fiasco (Kennedy send Cuba citizens to suicide), Pearl Harbour, spaceshuttle Challenger
- Social conditions leading to Group Think: isolated, homegenous groups, directive leader
- Tendency of decision-making groups to suppress dissent in the interest of group harmony
- Symptoms: 
	- overestimation of group's might and right
	- close-mindedness 有意见不敢说
	- pressure to uniformity (conformity pressure)
	- self-censorship: slient about concerns (since disagreements are uncomfortable)
	- illusion of unanimity
	- mindguard

### Effect of groups on performance
- Social facilitation: other people around -> better / worse performance, why?
	- Study (Triplett, 1898): boys reeled faster with audience
	- Zajonc's explanation: under audience, people perform better in easy tasks & worse in hard tasks
		- study: cockraches with / without mirror run a mage
	- Evaluation apprehension
	- Distraction - conflict
- Social loafing: slack off in groups unless individual input can be monitored / recognized



## Module 17 Romantic Relationship
### Dating 
- Study (Festinger, Schacter, and Back): closer in geolocation (proximity) -> Better friend relationship
	- Power of situation
- **Mere exposure phenomenon** expose more -> like more
- Physical attractiveness
	- Computer Dance I (Walster, Walster, and Berscheid 1966): Tell dancers that they are paired with people suited for them based on personality tests but actually randomly assigned
		- Result: whether people enjoy the dance depends on physical attractiveness of partners
	- Computer Dance II: Let people choose the mate from 9 people
		- **Matching phenomenon** The tendency for men and women to choose as partners those who are a “good match” in attractiveness and other traits 丑配丑，美配美 (high correlation)
		- Did not consider possibility of rejection
	- Pick a date study (Berscheid and Dion) expected strong matching phenomenon, but rejection did not affect picking mate
	- **Physical-attractiveness stereotype** beautiful people are good at other things as well
- Similarity and Liking (tend like people that are similar to us)
	- More similarity -> relationship lasts longer

### From initiation to development
- Models of development
	- self-disclosure and self-penetration model
		- disclosure reciprocity: 你和我分享了你的秘密，我也想和你分享我的秘密
		- two people ideally should have the same amount of disclosure of self with each other at every time
		- A has less disclosure than B -> B would wonder why A does not tell a lot of things about A
		- A has more disclosure than B -> B would think it's wierd for A to tell too much stuff
	- 2-factor theory of emotion
		- early stage: all-consuming, passion & love, arousal
			- Attribution of love: tend to like people who show interest to them or people who make them feel good
			- e.g. suspension bridge study
		- late stage: attribution - People like who they trust
- Attachments in relationship
	- Early attachment styles (secure - 自身安全感强，自信, avoidant - 不想太近, anxious-ambivalent - 没安全感，不敢付出) might define the later relationship attachment style
	- Everyone is better off with people with secure attachment style
	- New research shows 4th attachment style: depends on positive / negative views of self and other people
- **Equity** A condition in which the outcomes people receive from a relationship are proportional to what they contribute to it 
	- **Long term equity** give in response to partner's need without expecting anything in return
	- **Perceived equity** feel whether two people are equal in the relationship (no overbenefit / underbenefit)
- Illusions in relationship
	- Illusion promotes relationship
	- Study (Murray and Holmes, 1993): 
		- Couples with / without conflicts under absence / presence of threat -> test amount of rationalization
		- Low conflicts: low rationalization in no threat; high rationalization in high threat
	- Study: self-esteem and illusions
		- high self-esteem people think the other loves them more; low SE -> less
- Companionate love: compatibility, friendship, continuation of passinate love
	- even arranged marriages are happy in the long run



## Readings

### Obedience
- Experimenter asked subjects (teacher) to administer electric shock whenever confederate (learner) gave the wrong answer
- Measure the max power subjects are willing to impose before they refuse to continue further
- Result
	- 26/40 obey all commands even they knew confederates r painful (majority complied)
	- 14/40 quit at middle
- What account for such high obedience? 
	- Yale university 
	- Subject See victim and self as voluntary 
	- Pune chance to become the learner/teacher

### Video gaming & aggressive thoughts
- GAAM: short-term effect of video game violence & aggressive personality
- 4 main hypotheses emerge from GAAM
- Study 1 correlation study
	- 227 college students did questionnaires (Irratation Scale & Aggression Questionnaire)
	- Result: 
		- game & aggression positively correlated 
		- consistent with GAAM formulation
		- extensive exposure to video games -> create aggressive personality
		- exposure to video games + aggressive personality -> high delinquency & aggressive behavior
- Study 2 causation experiment (short-term effect)
	- examine effects of violent video game play on aggressive thought
	- 210 subjects; 2 (violent vs. non-violent) * 2 (low / high irritability) * 2 (gender)
	- violent & high irritable -> more aggression after lose trials
	- Men have more hostile view of the world 
- In short term, video game -> prime aggressive thoughts; long term, video game -> learn & practice aggressive scripts

### People's appraisal of past & present selves (Anne Wilson and Michael Ross)
- test if people tend to evaluate past selves more negatively than current selves, and even disparage past others
- study 1: use tape to describe what they were like at 16
- study 2: close-ended scale
- result of 1 & 2: depict past selves negatively
- study 3: compare students Sept.ratings in Sept. and their Sept. ratings in Nov.
- social comparison - people disparage their past selves for self-serving purposes


### Reactions to a Black Professional (Lisa Sinclair & Ziva Kunda)
- Try to test motivation to form an impression can activate desirable stereotypes & inhibit stereotypes that conflict with that impression
- Study 1: Criticism or Praise from a black evaluator (manager)
	- **method** interpersonal questionnaire -> black / white evaluator gave feedback -> assessing activation of black stereotype (word completion task & manager skill rating)
	- **result** black stereotype activated, but motivation is not quite clearly implicated
- Study 2: deciphering the role of motivation in stereotype inhibition & activation
	- **method** received subjects' responses & feedback of managers from subjects in study 1 -> measure activation
- Study 3: Reactions to a black doctor - exploring the simultaneous activation and inhibition of conflicting sterotypes
	- lexical-decision task to assess the activation of black stereotype
	- measure reaction times
- Study 4: Does prejudice moderate reactions to a black doctor
	- high / low prejudice 
	- spoken measure of interpersonal skills then positive evaluation from black doctor

- Study 1 Lab Study
	- Gave alcohol to maintain the same level for each participants
	- Measure attitudes and intentions to drink and drive
- Study 2 Telephone Diary Study
	- early condition: call answering machine as soon as they arrive at bar
	- late condition: call before they leave the bar
	- measure same as study 1 & BALs (amount of alcohol)


### Seeing virutes in Faults: Negativity and Transformation of interpersonal narratives in close relationships (Sandra Murray & John Holmes)
- Individual develop story-like representations of partners to relieve feelings of doubt from partners' faults
- Study 1: 
	- self-report to assess individuals' perceptions -> examine how dating individuals evaluate research
	- low / high conflicts in partners
- Study 2
