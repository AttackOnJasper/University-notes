# PSYCH 253 Social Psychology
- the scientific study of how people think about, influence, and relate to one another

## Module 1 History
- Social Psychology Founder: Kurt Lewin (Germany -> U.S.)
- Gestalt psychology: the perception of objects
	- Lewin applied this to try to understand the perception of people
- 3 parts of behavior (situation, perceiver, interaction)



## Module 2 Research Methods
- Try to revise theories over and over
- To infer causation: 
	- correlation
		- independent vars: control / experimental groups
		- dependent vars: measures
			- reliable (precise): get consistent results over and over again
			- valid (accuracy): measure what it is supposed to measure
	- time order 
	- eliminate other possible causes 
		- random assignment to each group
		- procedural control (keep process of groups as similar as possible)
- Surveys
	- random sampling == random selection: everyone has the same chance to be selected (so that small group can represent the whole group)
	- unbiased questions
		- Anchoring effects: pushing people in 1 direction
		- Framing effects: framing questions to seem like there is only one answer
- The ethics of experimentation
	- mundane realism: Degree to which an experiment is superficially similar to everyday situations.
		- a type of external validaty
	- experimental realism: Degree to which an experiment absorbs and involves its participants
		- should engage the participants
	- demand characteristics: Cues in an experiment that tell the participant what behavior is expected
		- To reduce this effect, experimenter standardize their instructions e.g. video taping



## Module 3 Conformity: A change in behavior or belief to accord with others e.g. sprint planning (how and why people do that?)
- Subsets: compliance, obedience, acceptance
- The Sherif Study (1935)
	- Steady light in dark room -> think it's moving due to autokinetic phenomenon -> cannot tell if it's moving by comparing surrounding -> people come to agree how far it's moved over several days
	- Transmission of beliefs: 5 generations (Jacobs and Campbell, 1961)
	- **Informational influence** value others ideas
- Asch 'comparing lines' Study: would one agrees something wrong but other people saying it's right? (try to find out why people follow Hilter)
	- ask to take part in a study of perceptual judgments
	- unambigous stimuli; 7 confederates say opposite
	- 37% subjects gave the wrong answer; 70% subjects gave wrong answer at least once
	- **Normative influence** go along by external pressure when people do not agree


## Module 4 helpness
### Why one would help
- The good samaritan study
	- conditions: early / late / on time for an appointment & meet a person needs help half way
	- situation influences whether people would help
- Smoke-filled Room Study (Latine Daley): would help only if perceive the incident as an emergency
- Lady in Distress Study
	- A lady cries in the middle of way for help under conditions: alone / with stranger / confederate / friend
	- **Pluralistic ignorance**: a majority of group members privately reject a norm, but incorrectly assume that most others accept it, and therefore go along with it. 
- Seizure Study
	- One would help if he / she is responsible
	- **Diffusion of responsibility** occurs when there r multiple people
		- reduced if less people & less psychological distance
- Decision Tree to help: notice the incident -> treat as emergency -> think I m responsible -> help
- Audience inhibition: embarrassed or worried about how other observers will view them

### Social Norms Impact
- Norm of Reciprocity
- Norm of Equity: overbenefitted should help underbenefitted
- Norm of Social Responsibility
- Norm of Justice: help those who deserve it

### Mood Impact
- Good mood -> help more
	- Cookie Study: students received cookies -> donated more money
	- Dime in Phone Booth Study: more likely to help if call back is within 8 min
	- Why? 
		- Think helping is positive
		- Maintain the good mood
- Bad mood -> may help more (esp. guilt)
	- The lie study: lied people would feel guilty -> help more
- Empathy (Batman's model)
	- high empathy -> try to reduce others' distress -> switch off electric shock on someone else
	- low empathy & watched others suffer from shock -> try to reduce own distress -> switch off



## Module 5 Aggression (Physical or verbal behavior intended to hurt someone)
- Heat & aggression are weakly correlated

### Frustration & aggression
- Frustration-aggression theory: frustrate
	- Study (Dollard, Doob, Miller)
	- Frustrates when goal is blocked. e.g. American South -> if cotton production is low -> more slaves die
- Revision: frustration -> anger -> aggression
	- Aggressive cues
		- weapons effect studies (presence of weapons)
		- Black uniform (sports team)

### Modeling & aggression
- Bobo Doll Study: children watch people beating dolls -> beat dolls many times when they play with it
- TV -> aggression
	- make people immune to aggression (adaptive to aggression)
	- easy to imitate aggression (Bandura study)
	- tend to commit violence (porn)
		- justify more on rape
		- Sexual promiscuity & hostile masculinity -> Coerciveness to women
- ways that prolonged viewing of violence in media can change how we think
	- develop violent **social scripts** (Culturally provided mental instructions for how to act in various situations.)
	- desensitization: adaptation e.g. 公开讨论性话题
	- altered perceptions of reality (e.g. think world is scary)
	- cognitive priming: think with more aggressive ideas



## Module 6 Self
- Self-reference effect (think about how something relates to self; memory)

### Self-schemas (Hazel Markus)
- how people think about themselves / characteristic
- influence thinking speed
- Working self-concept: a subset of self-schemas used at a particular time
- Study (Markus and Kunda)
	- answer questions with confederates
	- too many differences -> tend to activate 'similarity' schema -> say 'me' quickly
	- too many similarities -> tend to activate 'dissimilar' schema -> say 'not me' quickly
- Possible selves

### Self concepts formation
- by other people's perception (Cooley and Mead)
- by introspections (bad)
	- Nibett and Wilson Studies: have little understanding of our inside
		- Tide detergent: words subjects tried to recall affected the brand they came up
		- Ratings of cold / warm prof
		- Affective forecasting
- affected by social context: want to describe self as standing out from rest
- Social Comparison Theory
	- gain self concepts by comparing with others / with ourselves in the past
		- distort memory to derogate self & feel better (self-serving bias)

### Self-serving bias (tendency to perceive self favorably)
- **False Consensus** tendency to overestimate commnality of one's opinions
- **False uniqueness** think that few others behave or think like u
- Unrealistic optimism e.g. I will pass this even if pass rate is 5%
- Overestimation of contributions and abilities: think contribute more than rest of team
	- Ross and Sicoly
- Explanations of success / failure: internal / external attribution e.g. 篮球赛输赢
- Basking in reflected glory: we win; they lose
	- Study: feedback & badges
- Self-handicapping: produce excuses in case if bad performance e.g. exam & drinking / excuse for a bad test
	- try to prevent self from getting hurt (self-serving bias)

### Why do we have self-serving bias
- **self-affirmation theory** maintain positive self-image
- **self-evaluation meaintenance theory** maintain self-esteem
	- change distance from others
	- change how important something is to us e.g. score is not important if fail the exam
	- change our perception of how well we did

### Self-presentation (express oneself in a favorable way)
- Self monitoring: high / low self-monitors
- Self verification: present to maintain self-views (even negative views)



## Module 7 Module 07 - Attribution and Person Perception
### Definitions
- **Attribution Theory** The theory of how people explain others’ behavior e.g. internal dispositions (enduring traits, motives, attitudes) or to external situations
### Person perception
- Asch's Gestalt Model of Person Perception
	- Study: perceive people from a list of descriptive words
		- perception depends on order of words / words with strong meanings / context of other words
### Perceiving Non-Verbal Behaviour
- Facial expressions
- Body language

### Heider Phenomenological Model
- how do we attribute what type of a person someone is from their behaviors
	- investigate people's general tendencies
- Brunswick Lens Model
	- attribution of causality (person / situation) e.g. worker's fault or workplace's fault?
	- attribution of responsibility (intention / foreknowledge)

### Two Classic Theories of Attribution
- Jones and Davis' Correspondent Inference Theory
	- **Correspondent Inference** behavior reflects traits & types of person
	- **spontaneous trait inference** An automatic inference of a trait after exposure to someone’s behavior
	- Factors affecting whether correspondent inference is applicable
		- if people choose / are forced to do something
		- whether a behavior is expected
		- noncommon cause / effect e.g. 为party去某个大学
- Kelley's Covariation Model
	- Covariation principle: multiple people engage in same behavior
	- Figure out the cause of behavior (internal / external)
	- 3 kinds of information
		- Consensus: To what extent do others in this situation behave similarly
			- yes -> external; no -> internal
		- Distinctiveness: How specific is the person’s behavior to this particular situation
			- yes -> external (其他都不喜欢就喜欢这部电影，说明是电影好) / no -> internal
		- Consistency: How consistent is the person’s behavior in this situation

### How Do We Make Attributions
- Fundamental attribution error
	- tend to think of people’s actions are due to who they are rather than the situation
	- Study (Jones and Harris 1967): Castro speech
		- People attributed speech attitudes to speechwriters' even if speechwriters are assigned to write the speech
	- Study (Ross, Amabile, and Steinmetz)
		- everyone (contestatns & observers) thought questioners (subjects who gave questions) were smarter
- The actor observer bias
	- attribute more causes to situation for ourselves (self serving)
	- make situational attributions in first person point of view
	- make fundamental attribution error when they are self-aware (look at themselves from third person point of view)
- Two step model of attribution (Gilbert)
	- person attribution then corrected based on situation

### Schemas (guide our processing of information; context)
- e.g. instructions to wash clothes
- e.g. flipping cards with / without schemas -> accuracy varies a lot
- 2 Heuristics (Daniel Kahneman, Amos Tversky)
	- Representativeness Heuristic 
		- stereotype
	- Availability Heuristic
		- availability of something influences how likely we think it is
		- e.g. # of k(.)+ vs # of ..k(.)+
		- e.g. 美国不安全 (只听过枪击案)
- guide reconstruction of memory
	- Study: bring a schema to ask people who just see the car accident  -> recall the speed of vehicle during accident a lot faster



## Module 08 - Stereotyping and Prejudice
### Motivational Theories of Prejudice
- Realistic Conflict Theory (Sherif)
	- Sherif's Robber's Cave Experiment
		- Ran summer camp & divide 2 groups to compete over scarce resources
		- Superordinate goal that can only be achieved by 2 groups together helps repair the intergroup relations
- Social Identity Theory
  	- **Any distiction** between groups causes favoritism for own group
	- Minimal Group Experiment: 
		- Study 1: divided based on trivial difference -> gave more points to own group
		- Study 2: divided based on preference for abstract art -> still had favorism
	- Spencer's Minimal Group Study: students from UMichigan & from Ohio State
- Prejudice and Self-Image Maintenance
	- Better group & social identity -> better self identity -> feels better
	- Study (Fein and Spencer) Jewish American Princess
		- Got negative feedback on IQ test -> Low self-esteem -> think Jewish did much worse in workplace than Italian (to increase self-esteem)

### Cognitive Theories of Stereotyping
- Too much complexity in world -> form schema to simplify -> categorize people
- How Do Stereotypes Form?
	- Out-group Homogeneity Effect 黑人长得都差不多
	- **Illusory Correlations** Perception of a relationship / correlation where none exists (esp. in minorities) e.g. 认为妹子打游戏都不行
		- Rare things got overemphasized in memory (esp. undesired behaviors)
- How Are Stereotypes Perpetuated (保持)?
	- Cognitive theory accounts for this
	- Study (Esses and Zanna, 1995) Mood and Stereotype
		- Bad mood -> distinctive traits become more negative

### The Changing Face of Stereotyping
- Survey Findings - Past and Present
	- Princeton Trilogy Study (1933, 1950, 1972)
		- ask people to assign personality traits to 20 racial groups
		- Overt stereotypes -> subtle forms e.g. 有黑人邻居就搬家
- Subtler Forms of Prejudice - Earlier Studies
	- Pencil Poking study (Sagar and Schofield)
		- when black children is poking with pencil, all other children see him as trying to hurt the other instead of getting attention
	- Aversive racism
		- people would not make overt prejudice comments
	- Helping study
		- offer more help to black & ask less help from black
	- Inadmissable Evidence Study
- Subtler Forms of Prejudice - Recent Studies
	- The Amadou Diallo Story
	- Correll, Park, and Judd (2003)
		- in video game, more likely to shoot black people
- Implicit and Explicit Stereotyping
	- Implicit stereotyping: occur outside our awareness
	- Study (Spencer, Fein, Wolfe, Fong, 1998): word completion task; more negative words given black faces flashed
	- Study (Sinclair and Kunda, 1999)
- Changing Prejudice and Stereotyping



## Module 10 Social Comparison Theory
### Schachter's fear and affiliation studies
- Thesis: fear is not an internal state; it's how we relate to other people
- Basic idea: fear is shaped through social comparison
- Independent variable: warm doctor vs cold doctor

**Social Comparison Theory**: when u want to understand, u look at how others respond

### Two Factor Theory of Emotion
- Social comparison helps us understand emotion
- Brain get aroused -> compare how others label -> label those arousals as specific emotions
- Study 1: Euphoria
	- Conditions: Tell participants that pinephrine will make u feel 1. nothing (igorant) 2. calm (misinformed) 3. happy (informed)
	- All groups wait together with a hyper person
	- Result:
		- No social comparison is done in informed group (everyone treats happyness as expected side effect of vitamin)
		- Misinformed / ignorant group report feeling happier
	- Conclusion: people feel happier when they have arousal they cannot explain
- Study 2: Anger
	- Keep same conditions as the last one; the only difference is that the confederate is angry.
- Review: 
	- When people are aroused and cannot explain it, they look at other people
	- An example of interaction of person & situation
	- Perceiver shapes reality

### Bridge Study (Dutton and Aron)
- Situation: attrative women approach men in either parking lots or the middle of the bridge, ask them questions, and give them phone numbers. 
- Questions: How many call backs are there?
- Result: bridge: 50% call backs; parking lot: 10% call backs

### How to make social comparison?
- Mirror others facial expressions to learn emotions & make social comparison
- Study 1 (James-Laird): let participants move parts of faces -> form smiles -> lead better moods
- Study 2 (Strack): hold pen with teeth -> good mood; hold pen with lips -> bad mood （近朱者赤）

### Early Roots of Social Comparison Theory
- Bennington Study (Newcomb, 1947): 
	- Conducted in Bennington college: conservative, rich, girl school
	- Reference group: how and when students change their attitudes (positive / negative)
- Schachter study, 1950
	- Confederate opposes the decision made by a group, then group exerts pressure on deviant to bring them in line
- Festinger study, 1954
	- Learn measure of attitude & ability by comparing with similar others
	- **Unidirectional push upwards**: compare with others who is slightly better （跟jeff打乒乓球）

### Up / down social comparison
- Brickman and Bulman
- Wood, Taylor, and Lichtman (Breast cancer)
- Lockwood and Kunda 1997: 
	- Attainability is very important in social comparison: （能不能达到）
		- upward -> attainability is inspring; unattainability is demoralizing

## Module 11 Cognitive Dissonance Theory and Attitudes
### Cognitive Dissonance Theory （自我安慰）
- Example: why people keep smoking even they know it's bad
- Idea: cognitive dissonance is aroused whenever someone holds 2 cognitions that are psychologically inconsistent
	- How to resolve? Resolve it in the easiest way (try to rationalize their attitudes towards their behaviors)
- Study 1 (Festinger & Schachter):
	- The only participant observation study in social psychology
	- Prophecy Fail: failed prophecy for 1956 leads to conflicting cognitions of the group that believes the prophecy
	- The group eventually thinks cult saved the world & becomes more committed to the cult 
- Study 2 (Brehm): Free Choice Paradigm
	- People re-rate their choices higher than their rating at the first time
	- Conflict: bad features of people's choice
- Insufficient Justification (Festinger & Carlsmith):
	- People change their attitudes to be consistent with their behaviors
	- e.g. Get $1 to lie about liking something instead of $20 makes people like that thing more (Justify their behavior)
	- e.g. Go to Amazon with lower salary
- Forced Compliance Theory: people will not change their attitude to match their behavior that they are forced to do (they think that they are forced to do, so they don't have dissonace)
	- High choice: a trick that lets participants think that they have many choices
	- Low choice: force participants to do something
- Effort Justification (Aronson & Mills, 1960s)
	- Let women talk about sex in a group
	- Mild initiation condition (read a list of words) vs. severe initiation condition (read to male experimenter)
	- Severe condition: women suffer reading in front -> try to justify their behavior -> think that the group is more fun

### Self-perception theory
- Daryl Bem
	- believed cognitive dissonance is wrong; instead, people watch their behaviors & infer their attitudes by watching
	- replicate the experiments & let observers to explain participants' behaviors
- Overjustification effect (Lepper, Green, and Nisbett)
	- have expected rewards: people think u doing it for external motiviation rather than internal motivation
	- study: Children and Magic marker
		- no reward condition / unexpected reward condition: observer would say children like markers
		- expected reward condition: observer would say children play markers for rewards

### Important difference: Self-perception - no arousal; Cognitive dissonance - arousal due to conflict
- How to check if aroused?
	- Dissonance and pill study (Zanna & Cooper 1974)
		- nervous pill group -> attribute dissonance to pill -> no attitude change
		- hidden effect pill group -> attitude change a little
		- calm pill group -> attitude change a lot to resolve dissonance
		- showed that arousal level matters -> cognitive dissonance is right
	- Fazio, Zanna, Cooper 1977
		- get an integration of 2 theories
		- latitude of acceptance: e.g. 10% tuition increase or 3% tuition increase
		- no arousal within latitude of acceptance (self-perception), and vice versa
		- most attitude change when high choice & no booth (no explanation / reward)

### Self and Dissonance
- Self-affirmation theory
	- Self concept is threatened -> need to change the attitude to remove the threat
	- Self identity can buffer from self-threat
		- White coat scientists study (Steele, Hopp and Gonzales)
	- Self-threat has different effects on people with differnt self-esteem
		- CD rating study: people with low self-esteem shows more dissonance
		- only get dissonance when there might be negative consequences

### Attitude Behavior Consistency
- Attitudes not always predict behaviors (e.g. trump建长城)
- Strong situational pressure -> attitudes follow behavior
	- Foot-in-the-door phenomenon (car sign)
	- Low-ball technique (raise price)
- Weak situational pressure / strong person factor -> attitudes predict behavior

## Module 12 Self-Fulfilling Prophecies and Intergroup Relations

### Self-Fulfilling Prophecies
- Definition: a prediction made that is initially not true, but becomes true because the prediction is made
	- e.g. stock market: everyone thinks the market would crash -> sell all stocks -> crash
- Teacher Expectancy Effect (Rosenthal and Jacobson)
	- Idea: teacher's expectation about how start a student is going to be actually determines how smart that student will become
- Zanna and Pack (1975)
	- Women rate themselves about whether they are traditional, then interact with attractive / not-attractive guys to find out what kind of women they like
	- Would like to investigate whether the women would change their performance on performing a task based on what the men like
	- Women would change to become more traditional / non traditional based on their desired men's expectations
- Word, Zanna, and Cooper 1974
	- Idea: racial stereotype influence behavior
	- Let interviewer treat white guys as black guys
	- Result: white guys perform very bad (worse than black guys)
- Pieces of self-fulfilling prophecies
	- **Confirmation bias**: see what u expect to see
		- Darley & Gross 1983
			- ask watching a girl taking test & determine what kind of student she is
			- see 2 backgrounds: rich / poor (social-economic status)
			- difficult to tell how smart she is from her answers
			- Result: rich -> smart; poor -> dumb
	- **Confirmatory Hypothesis Testing**: getting people to say what you expect
		- Snyder and Swann 1978 (extraverted / interverted)
			- groups sound like interverts / extraverts based on questions they got asked
	- **Behavioural Confirmation**: cause people to act the way you expect
		- e.g. teacher expectancy effect study
		- Snyder, Tanke, and Berscheid 1977
			- give men the fake photos of girls they talk to -> behavior changed -> women act in accord with the stereotype

### Stereotypes <-> Self-fulfilling prophecies
- Crocker and Major 1987
- Major, Spencer, Schmader, Wolfe, and Crocker
	- bias primed: black won't feel bad
	- not primed: black will feel bad

### Stereotypes Threat and Achievement
- Study (Spencer, Steele, and Quinn, 1999): Women and Math (differe when w/ or w/o gender difference)
- Study (Steele and Aronson 1995): Black & white verbal performance (differ when diagnostic or non-diagnostic)
- Commercials and women's career aspirations (Davis, Spencer)
	- women fear that others would reduce them to a negative stereotype


## Module 13 Social Psychology and Health
### Health and Control
- Executive rats: People with more control of bad situations are more healthy
- Learned helplessness 
	- Study: put dogs in cage (cannot get out); move -> electric shock
	- People in learned helplessness make internal, stable, and global attributions
- Control -> less learned helplessness -> less pessimism -> optimism
	- Study (Rodin and Langer): Control in nursing home (15 months life)
		- People with more control are more happy and live longer (mental & physical health)
- Importance of Value System and Meaning
	- Children Lost Study (McIntosh, Sylver, and Wortman 1992): length of recovery time of losing child
		- Make meaning of an event gives sense of control

### Health and Stress
- Primary Appraisal for a life changing event: is it a threat or challenge?
- Daily hassle > life changing event
	- Dorms and illness study: better dorm -> less medical visit
	- Interpersonal conflict is the worst

### Models of depression
- Pennebaker: inhibition -> stress & confrontation -> relief
- Nolen-Hoeksma: negative mood -> self-focus -> negative mood

### Alcohol Myopia
- Why alcohol has different effects?
	- alcohol restricts attention & exacerbate the power of situation
	- usually act as a great distractor (less self-focus)
	- however sometimes can focus on self, making people more depressed (e.g. 周缘哭)
- Aggression
	- "The angry drunk": drunk people only know the straight way to fight back
	- Cues while drunk are more effective
- Helpness (by exacerbation of the power of situation)
	- Strong situational pressure (e.g. face-to-face request) -> drunk people more likely to help
- Drunk driving (situational pressure)
	- tends to agree drunk driving after drunk & situation pressure: e.g. short distance, drop off friends (restricted attention to only the situation instead of considering other things)
- Date rape (酒后乱性)
	- Power of situation: one is aroused
	- Attention is restricted to arousal so that the consequence is not considered
	- Date rape is justified while drunk

### Social Support & Health
- pros: generally good, aid treatment, help process feelings
- cons: could be annoying, may develop binge-eating

### Clinician's impact
- Interaction allows patients to develop trust on doctor, more satisfied, and better health outcome


## Module 14 Law
### Eyewitness 
- Can be biased; often pick up the wrong person
- Study (biased line-up procedures): 
	- conditions: unbiased (culprit may not be here) / biased (culprit should be here) instructions, culprit in / not in the line up
	- results:
		- unbiased + culprit in: 100% correct
		- unbiased + culprit not in: 60% correct
		- biased + in: 70% correct
		- biased + not in: 20% correct
- Questioning might distort people's memory
	- Study: Making people believe that they did something that they did not do (computer typing task)
		- conditions: instruct to type fast / slow, control / witness
		- a button to crash the computer; computer crashes; get an interview and ask them to confess 
		- check false confession rate & the percentage that believe they did the wrong thing

### Jury
- How do they decide guilty or not?
	- Weigh all pros / cons
	- Try to construct a narrative from pieces of information (e.g. Kobe & women told different stories)
	- not a solo activity
- Dynamics
	- Majority influence
		- two-thirds rule: 2/3 before walking in -> 100% after
		- group polarization (everyone's arguments go more extreme)
		- reassurance
	- Minority Influence

### Problems of trial
- Would Excluded Evidence affect the judgment of jury?
	- Study (Kassin nad Sommers 1997): admissible excluded evidence has a huge effect
- Publicity: jurors find it hard to ignore pre-trial publicity

## Module 15 Social Psychology and Environment
### Crowding
- Global warming
- City get crowded -> performance drops
	- Study: verbal problem solving
		- conditions: less / more people with / without perceived control (Illusion of control)
		- crowding together in a room -> performance drops
- Considers crowding if > 1 people in a room
- Violence increases with more crowding. e.g. in a prison

### Social Dilemmas (how people negotiate splitting up resources)
- Prisoner's Dilemma
	- always better off if they confess, but group effect is the worst if both confess
	- self interest vs group interest
- Tragedy of the Commons e.g. English fishes, Canadian fishing industry, Global warming (country's benefit vs. world's benefit)

### Money and Happiness
- There is a weak correlation: money buys happiness if it provides basic necessities
	- Everybody being better off does not provide happiness (e.g. inflation)
	- Happiness arised from social comparison 
	- Adaptation-level phenomenon: people take what they have for granted (less effect the money has)
	- diminishing returns


## Module 16 Social Psychology and Business
- Leadership styles (Lewin, Lipett, and White, 1930s)
	- Styles: Authoritarian (order), Democratic (vote), Laissez Faire (do nothing) 
	- Measures aggression & productivity
	- Democratic style is the best
- Gourp Polarization
	- definition: if groups discuss something, the opinion becomes more extreme
	- Rishy shift: group more risky than individual
	- Study (Myers and Bishop 1970)
		- People with high / low prejudice about an issue discuss (after discussion high -> more opposed, low -> more supportive)
	- why it happens?
		- social comparison: want to look different if others have same ideas
		- more and more arguments push the team into an aspect further
		- Close-mindedness
		- Pressures towards uniformity
- Group think e.g. Bay of Pigs Fiasco, Pearl Harbour, spaceshuttle Challenger
	- Social conditions leading to Group Think: isolated, homegenous groups, directive leader
	- Symptoms
- Effect of groups on performance
	- Social facilitation: other people around -> better / worse performance, why?
		- Zajonc's explanation: under audience, people perform better in easy tasks & worse in hard tasks
			- study: cockraches with / without mirror run a mage
		- Evaluation apprehension
		- Distraction
	- Social loafing


## Module 17 Romantic Relationship
### Dating 
- Study (Festinger, Schacter, and Back): closer in geolocation (proximity) -> Better friend relationship
	- Power of situation
- Mere exposure phenomenon Study: expose more -> like more
- Physical attractiveness
	- Computer Dance I (Walster, Walster, and Berscheid 1966): Tell dancers that they are paired with people suited but actually randomly assigned
	- Computer Dance II: Let people choose the mate from 9 people
		- Matching phenomenon: 丑配丑，美配美 (high correlation)
		- Did not consider possibility of rejection
	- Pick a date study (Berscheid and Dion): 
		- rejection does not affect picking mate
- Similarity and Liking (tend like people that are similar to us)
	- More similarity -> relationship lasts longer

### From initiation to development
- Models of development
	- self-disclosure and self-penetration model
		- two people ideally should have the same amount of disclosure of self with each other at every time
		- A has less disclosure than B -> B would wonder why A does not tell a lot of things about A
		- A has more disclosure than B -> B would think it's wierd for A to tell too much stuff
	- 2-factor theory of emotion
		- early stage: all-consuming, passion & love, arousal
			- Attribution of love: eople tend to like people who show interest in them or people who make them feel good
			- e.g. suspension bridge study
		- late stage:
			- Attribution: People like who they trust
- Attachments in relationship
	- Early attachment styles (secure, avoidant, anxious-ambivalent) might define the later relationship attachment style
	- Everyone is better off with people with secure attachment style
	- New research shows 4th attachment style: depends on positive / negative views of self and other people
- Illusions in relationship
	- Illusion promotes relationship
	- Study (Murray and Holmes, 1993): 
		- Couples with / without conflicts under absence / presence of threat -> test amount of rationalization
		- Low conflicts: low rationalization in no threat; high rationalization in high threat
	- Study: self-esteem and illusions
		- high self-esteem people think the other loves them more; low SE -> less
- Companionate love: compatibility, friendship, continuation of passinate love


## Readings
### Obedience
