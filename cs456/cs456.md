# CS 456 Networks

## Module 1
### Internet
- a global system of interconnected computer networks that use the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link devices worldwide.
- **Service view**: Infrastructure that provides services + API to applications
- **Elements view** 
	- Hosts: end systems (connected computing devices, including client, server)
	    - sends packets of data
	    - trasmission delay: L (length of packet)/R (transmission rate)
	- Packet Switches: forward packets

### Protocols
* control sending / receiving of messages 
* define format, order of messages sent and received among network entities, and actions taken on message transmission, receipt
* e.g. TCP, IP, HTTP

### Network structures
- Network edge: hosts, data center
- Communication links & Access (bandwidth, shared / dedicated)
	- DSL: connect network using a phone line
	- Cable: from home to ISP router 
	- **frequency division multiplexing**: different channels transmitted in different frequency bands
- Network core: routers, network of networks
    - collection of interconnected routers
    - **Packet Switching** hosts break application-layer messages into packets
        - forward packets from one router to next
        - each packet transmitted at full link capacity
        - **store and forward** entire packet must arrive at router before it can be transmitted on next link
    - key network core functions:
        - **routing**: determines source destination route taken by packets
        - **forwarding**: move packets from routerâ€™s input to appropriate router output
