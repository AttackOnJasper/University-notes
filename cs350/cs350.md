Operation Systems

# Module 1 Intro

3 views of operating system:

	Application: provides execution environment for running programs (processor time, memory space, hardware, isolation)
	System: manages hardware resources
	Implementation: concurrent, real-time program

Kernel: part of OS that responds to system calls, interrupts, and exceptions

OS = kernel + utlity programs + coomand interpreters + library

# Module 2 Threads & Concurrency

Thread: 
* represents control state of an executing program
* has associated context: CPU state & stack
* thread control block: data structure used to store a thread context

Context Switch: 
* Pause execution of one thread & resume another i.e. scheduling + dispatching
* Causes: yield, exit (terminate), blocks, preempted

Scheduling:
* Round robin scheduling

Interrupt:
* an event that occurs during the execution of the program
* caused by hardware

# Module 3 Synchronization
