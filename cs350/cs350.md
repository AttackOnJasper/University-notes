CS350 Operation Systems
=====

# Module 1 Intro

3 views of operating system:

	Application: provides execution environment for running programs (processor time, memory space, hardware, isolation)
	System: manages hardware resources
	Implementation: concurrent, real-time program

Kernel: part of OS that responds to system calls, interrupts, and exceptions

OS = kernel + utlity programs + coomand interpreters + library

# Module 2 Threads & Concurrency

Thread: 
* represents control state of an executing program
* has associated context: CPU state & stack
* thread control block: data structure used to store a thread context
* 3 states: running, ready, blocked

Context Switch: 
* Pause execution of one thread & resume another i.e. scheduling + dispatching
* Causes: yield, exit (terminate), blocks, preempted

Scheduling:
* Round robin scheduling

Interrupt:
* an event that occurs during the execution of the program
* caused by hardware

# Module 3 Synchronization
Mutual exclusion: 
* make sure that only one thread at a time uses a shared object
* hardware: prevent interrupt, test-and-set, compare-and-swap
* software: spinlock, semaphore, lock, condition variable

Critical section: the part of a program in which the shared object is accessed

Atomic operation: sequence of execution without context switch or preemption

Volatile: object may change for reasons which cannot be determined from the local code & prevents optimization

Starvation: a thread waiting forever

Condition variable: used from within the critical section that is protected by the lock

# Module 4 Process & Kernel
Process: 
* abstraction of a program in execution
* consists of address space, threads, and other resources (e.g. open files, sockets)

Kernel: A program running in privileged mode: control hardware & isolate itself from processes

System call: 
* interface between processes and kernel
* allows process to run in privileged mode

Exception: 
* another way that control is transferred from a process to the kernel
* conditions that occur during the execution of an instruction by a process
* detected by hardwares
* handled by kernel exception handler
