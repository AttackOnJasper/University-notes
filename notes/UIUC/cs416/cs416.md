# Data Wrangling

## Data Preprocessing

### Data cleaning
- CSV: comma separated value. Quotes / commas are used to separate each fields
	- First line consists of field names
- Dimension
	- Independent variable
- Measures:
	- Values, either quatitative or qualitative, over dimensions such as time, country
	- Note that year is a qualitative measure
	- Dependent variable
- Indicator
	- The meaning / fact / name of the measures
- In Tableau, we can hide / filter data to get the data we want

### Pivoting
- In tableau, 2 options to display population over year
	1. We can put measure values as the column and measure names as the row to display a 2-D diagram of the measure
	1. Pivoting: in dataset page, we can drag all columns (as the row) via column names, right click, and select `pivot`, which does a transpose of the data from the columns to the row
		- The previous measures of the pivotted fields become dimensions in the new table
- Pivoting reshapes the data to make it easier for query and visualization
- When pivot 3 fields
	- e.g. `Measure A, Measure B, Measure C, year1, year2, year3` -> 3 rows with `year1, year2, year3` as the first entry in the row
	- this replaces each record in the previous table with 3 records in the new table
		- each of 3 new records would have have the 3 pivotted fields, but would instead of have a new field indicating the preivous records' field name and the second new field indicating the previous record's field value.
	- number of records will * 3

### Table Joining
- Inner join: the union would result in records that have entries presented in both tables
	- e.g. returned result contains entries from both tables containing `id` that the other table also has
- Left join: the union would be inner join + any other left table entries
	- e.g. returns all left table entries + right entries that share the same `id` with the left table
- Right join: the union would be inner join + any other right table entries
- Outer join: the union would be all records from both tables


# Data Aggregation
- Aggregation: Projections of measurements across one or more dimensions
	- way to combine measurements into a simpler form
	- typically reduces dimensions
- The attribute function ATTR() checks to make sure that only one value for a measure is reported by the query. (However, that one value could be reported multiple times.) The attribute function is not projecting multiple values into a single value as an aggregation would, because if there were multiple different values present, the attribute function would result in the non-numeric asterisk character.

## Data as Variables
- Independent variables
	- When Independent Variables change, they can have an effect on Dependent Variables
- Dependent variables

## Aggregation
- e.g. sum, mean, median, min, max, variance

### Tableau Example
The LOD expression "Include [Country], AVG([Value])" means that the country dimension is no longer part of the AVG([Value]) aggregation, so a separate AVG() aggregation is computed for each country that computes its average value

## Count
- Converts nominal / ordinal data into quantitative data

## Binning 
- discretizes quantitative data into ordinal / nominal data
	- from continuous to discrete
	- e.g. `pandas.cut`
	- e.g. create a bar chart to estimate a continuous function

## Visualizating different data
1. 2 quantitative: scatterplots
1. 1 quantitative 1 ordinal: bar chart
1. 2 ordinal: table



# VisQL

## Polaris
- Designed to improve the interactive UI into the data
- Built on pivot tables, user selected rows and columns 
- Shelves: can help group and sort the data, and they can control which fields are being plotted horizontally, vertically, and which fields are being encoded as marks.

## Table Algebra
- e.g. records: A = {a1, a2, a3}, B = {b1, b2, b3}
- Cross Product
	- {a1b1, a1b2, a1b3, a2b1, ..., a3b3}
- Nesting
	- Cross product but only keeping the records where there exists an attribute / element that is presented in both set A and set B 

## Query
- `SELECT * Where {filters}`
- Sort: `ORDER BY`
- Aggregate filter: `HAVING {filters}`




# Human Brain Processor

- Read in chunks but we don't perceive it that way

## Hearing
- Sound parameters
	1. Pitch
	1. Amplitude
	1. Timbre - sound waveform 
- Cocktail party effect

## Hand-Eye Coordination
- Fitt's Law: $$ T = 600 + 240 * \log(1 + \frac{D}{S}) $$, where D is distance to target, S is size of the target

## Memory
- Types
	1. Sensory memory
	1. Working memory
		- Size: 7 items on avg
		- Persistence: ~ 7 secs
		- Recency effect
	1. Long term memory
		- Types

		- Jost's Law
	- Interference
		1. Proactive inhibition
		1. Retroactive inhibition

	1. Deductive reasoning - logical
	1. Inductive reasoning - induction
		- Inference
		- Includes generalization, extrapolation, interpolation

## Eye

### Retinal Processing
- Photoreceptors
	- Rod
	- Cone
- Ganglions (nerve cells)
	- X-cells: detect pattern
	- Y-cells: detect movement
- Blue wavelength is hard for retina to focus

### Colour perception
- The "eye colour space" are the 3 "channels" that are passed onto the brain, and the formulas given are how to convert the information from the retina's 3 channels: R(ed), G(reen), B(lue) into what gets sent into the brain. Those 3 channels that get sent to the brain are: black <=> white which maps to R(ed) + G(reen) from the retine, yellow <=> blue which maps to Y(ellow) - B(lue), and red <=> green which maps to R(ed) - G(reen).
- Human eye have the most difficulty focusing on blue colour
	- Because of the chromatic aberration of the eye's lens, the blue end of the optical spectrum of light tends to focus off the retina.

### Laterial Inhibition
- Horizontal cells accentuate and exaggerates differences in space and time
- That's why we can pick up changes even not looking at that direction
- It also helps the visual system see and accentuate shapes
- It can also interfere the perception

## Perceiving Perspective
- Foreshortening
	- Different depth perceived differently
- Linear Perspective
	- Farther -> smaller
- Size Constancy




# Computer Graphics

## 3D Graphics
- Simulate shapes with vector primitives e.g. triangles
	- Convert objects into triangle meshes
- Pixel Discretization
	- a rasterization process
- 3D Graphics pipeline
	1. Vertex processing
		- Taking vertices of 3D triangle surfaces and projecting them on an image plane
	1. Rasterization
		- Taking 2D triangles from the plane and converting them into pixels
	1. Pixel processing
		- figure out colours on each pixel

## Photorealism

### Techiques
1. Occulusion
	- observing one object blocking another
	- strongest clue
1. Illumination
	- shows how the surface is facing the light source (surface orientation)
	- also shows the surface material (in terms of light reflection)
		- Diffuse -> rough; Specular -> smoothness
1. Shadowing
	- Shows position
	- Is occlusion of a light source
1. Perspective
	- Size constancy cues - farther objects would be smaller
1. Stereopsis
	- Rendering from 2 different viewpoints; one for each eye 
	- e.g. VR
	- Provides relative cues of distance across an image
	- Useful when other cues are not available

## Non-photorealism
- Relies on psychology of perception
- Non-photorealistic lighting can be used
- Benefits
	1. Can help visualize cartoons and inter structure
	1. Easier to communicate shape without complex lighting


# Chart selection

## Data Visualization Framework

### Data Layer
- Responsibilities
	1. Getting data
	1. Data reformatting
	1. Relating date between different sources
	1. Analysis / aggregation

### Mapping Layer
- Converts data into geometric representation
- Data types
	- Quantitative: position, length


### Graphics Layer
- Converts geometry into images
- Colouring
- Managing interactions

## Data types
1. Qualitative
	1. Ordinal - discrete and ordered
	1. Nominal - discrete and unordered (cannot be compared)
	1. Categories - discrete and unordered
		- e.g. nationality, fruits
		- Year may be categorized if shouldn't be visualized in order
1. Quantitative
	- Discrete and ordered
1. Fields
	- Continuous and ordered
	- e.g. temperature
	- Sometimes the dates are ordered but not evenly splitted, in such cases we may treat them as continuous
1. Cyclic values
	- Continuous and unordered (values not comparable)
	- e.g. directions, hues

## Mapping
- Data types
1. Quantitative - Position, length, angle
1. Ordinal - Position, Density, Saturation
1. Nominal - Position, Hue, Texture

## Charts
- Types
	1. Bar chart - independent discrete / norminal data + dependent quantitative
	1. Line chart - indep. continous + dep. continuous
	1. Scatter plot - 2 indep. continuous
	1. Gantt chart - indep. continuous + indep. discrete quantitative / nominal
	1. Table - indep. quantitative / nominal

## Packing
- Cartogram: area of region outline shape scaled by data value
	- a distortion of a map of regions by data values associated with those regions.
	- Good for nominal value
- Choropleth: for ordinal data visualization, colouring the regions on the map with different saturation values and hues would be better than cartogram 

## Parallel Coordinates
- Colinearity can be captured as an intersection
- Problem
	1. Can only see the pairwise relationship between the axes



# Interactive Dynamics (Visually Ordering Data)

## Data & view specification
- Key Approaches
	1. Visualize data by choosing visual encodings
	1. Filter
	1. Sort
	1. Derive values or models from source data

### Visualize data by choosing visual encodings
- Visual encoding ways
	1. horizontal / vertial axis
	1. size of elements
	1. color of elements
- Interaction can be done by granting users abilities to specify visual encodings

### Sort

### Stacked Bar charts
- Matrix seriation
- Stacked bar chart
	- Can help plotting 2 dependent variables

## View Manipulation (Manipulating a data visualization)
- What's view manipulation
	- the ability to organize multiple charts into a dashboard
- Key Approaches
	1. Selecting items for further investigation
	1. Navigating scales from overview to detail
		- e.g. zoom / filter
	1. Organizing a dashboard of multiple charts
		- Datazen 
			- a tool that allows you to create multiple charts and drag them interactively into a dashboard
		- Layout design
			- Put different categories of data into different boxes
	1. Coordinating views / charts in a dashboard for linked, multi-dimensional exploration
		- brushing
		- cross-filtering

## Process & Provenance
- Key Approaches
	1. Recording the steps users / analysts have tried towards producing a data visualization
		- In tableau, we can record the interaction history
	1. Annotating patterns to document and highlight interesting aspects of the data
		- e.g. circle certain items, put box on certain data, add names
	1. Sharing views with others
		- enable collaboration
		- e.g. Tableau public
	1. Guide users through analysis tasks or stories
		- ensure others can reach similar conclusions


# Visualizing Multi-dimensional data


## Dimensionality Reduction
- find the right two-dimensional subspace of that high-dimensional coordinate data in order to display the data in a more intuitive manner

### Principal Component Analysis
- Principal Compoennt Analysis is a method of dimensionality reduction
- Identifying the largest magnitude dimensions that affect the result
- Benefits
	1. helps us find the directions where the data's varying a lot
- Idea: transforms sphere into an ellipsoid via linear algebra / covariance matrix
	- Eigenvalue: how ellipsoid is stretched and squashed
	- Eigenvector: what direction the stretching and squashing occur in
	- Keeps only the eigenvectors corresponding to the largest eigenvalues
	- Uses the eigenvectors corresponding to the largest eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of a high dimensional dataset to show the directions in the high dimensional space of the data where the data is varying the most.
- Note: it reveals principal directions where the data varies the most, but each one of these directions will not necessarily correspond to a single dimension of the dataset.

### Multidimensional Scaling (MDS)
- Another method for dimensionality reduction
- Layout points in a complete graph when you are given the desired distances between the points. The distances between points are perserved


# Visualizing relationships

## Graph and Network
- Types
	- Directed / undirected
	- Cyclic / acyclic
	- Tree
		- Minimally connected
	- Hierarchy
		- acyclic directed graph
		- this could be a tree, but could also not be
- Adjacency Matrix

## Force Directed Layout
- each of the nodes is applying a force to the current nodes position to form a layout

### Planar graph embedding
- What's embedding of a graph?
	- A different view with same properties
- Convert a graph with crossing edges to a planar graph
- Ways
	1. Tutte's method
		- Adjacency matrix
		- Laplacian Matrix
		- Solving system of linear equations to embed a planar graph
	1. Iterative method
		- can fix certain nodes' positions and then iteratively calculate the rest of the nodes' positions by taking the avg of the neighbouring nodes' positions

### GEM


## Centralities
- Measures of whether a node is in or close to the center of the graph
- ways of analyzing you know where a node should be positioned in a layout.
- e.g.
	1. Node degree
		- PageRank: number of incoming links
	1. Isolation metric
		- Total distance to all other nodes
		- Closeness centrality: $$ \frac{1}{isolation metric} $$
	1. Betweenness centrality
		- portion of all shortest paths between any two nodes that pass through the given node
		- high BC -> closer to centre
- Simplifiation
	- Removing edges with lowest BC that don't disconnect graph results in a tree shaped 'backbone'

## Edge Bundles
- Aggregate similar edges into edge bundles (group them together)

### Community Discovery
- Cluster nodes / edges into communities for finding 'similar' edges
- Via removing edges in decreasing BC order (i.e. removes center first)


## Tree Maps
- Idea
	1. Converts data to a tree map, which only have values at leaf at the beginning
	1. Fill values of parent from leaf to root recursively by summing up child node values
	1. Partition from root and maps quantities to area
	1. Colour areas to differentiate
- Good for visualizing hierarchy information
	- e.g. parent - child
- Relates region of hierarchy to the region on screen


# Visualizing Information

## Schneiderman's Mantra
- Procedure/Practice used for visualizing abstract information from large datasets 

### Overview First
- Provides big picture of the entire dataset
- Need to display all data in data sets
- Choose axes that evenly spread out the data
	- Can set tight bounds / use log scale to help spread out data

### Zoom
- Focus on a portion of the plotted data and get more details
- Considered as a filter on the range of values of the row and column fields of a scatterplot.
- 2 ways
	1. Selecting plot data
		- Clicking on specific button / area to expand and focus on a specific portion
		- Tableau has the functionality to present a zoom control for users to drag an area and zoom in
		- When zooming in, the users may lose the context of the data outside of the portion
			- To resolve this, we can use lens (via magnifying and distortion) to let users be able to see both focus and context
			- Types of lens
				1. Zoom lens
				1. Fisheye distortion lens
			- Tools
				1. D3 Javascript library
	1. Expanding axis fields

### Filter
- Filter out data based on specific attributes
- In Tableau, we can drag the attributes into the filter box

### Details on Demand
- Provides details when users requested
- Ways
	1. Tooltip: pop-up window when mouse is over the data point
	1. Field Selection: click and show

# Dashboard design
- Why Dashboard?
	- Visually organize the charts so the viewer can better find and understand the data through multiple charts.

## Building a WDI Dashboard
- Tableau has the functionality of selecting in one graph also highlighting the same group in the other graph

## Dashboard Layout & Navigation
- See `View Manipulation` section

## Cross Filtering
- The same filter is used for multiple charts.
- Benefits
	1. Controlling the filter through one chart has its effects realized in a second chart.

## Brushing 
- Manipulating a filter in one chart to see its effect in other charts
	- e.g. drag data window and see changes in other diagrams
- Feels like painting one section of the chart and seeing its effects on another, through an "action" that relates the selections and filters between multiple charts.


# Interactive Storytelling

## Modes of visualization
1. Interactive visualization (reader-driven)
	- This visualization does not contain a narrative component, so it would be used to investigate data to answer a user's question, but does not tell a specific story.
	- Used for discovery
	- Renders based on input
1. Presentation visualization (author-driven)
	- Used for communication 
	- Intended for large group / mass audience
	- Does not support user input
1. Interactive Storytelling (in between interactive visualization and presentation visualization)
	- Present via interactive webpages (allows user input; engaging)
	- Using data to tell a story; narrative
	- Allows viewers to explore further
	- A popular medium for data journalism

# Web page programming

## HTML & CSS & Javascript
- Debugging tips
	1. Breakpoint
	1. 'Inspect' to open developer console
	1. Use console logs
- Javascript basics
	- Javascript supports arrays with numerical indices but with arbitrarily typed elements
	```
	var values = [4,8,15,16,23,'forty-two'];
	```
	- Object support
	```
	var c1 = {name: 'USA', currency: 'dollar'};
	document.write(c1.name);
	```

## DOM (Document object model)
- DOM hierarchy
	- document
		1. html
			1. head
				1. title
			1. body
				1. h tag
				1. p tag
- DOM expressions
	1. `document` - the main DOM object
	1. `getElementById`: the method that returns the DOM object corresponding to the HTML element with a given id
	1. `innerHTML` - method that returns the DOM object corresponding to the text

## SVG (Scalable vector graphics)
- Embedded in HTML using the `<svg>` tag
- Origin: upper left corner of canvas
- Items should be put into `<g>` tags, which can be used to position

# D3 (Data-Driven Documents)
- A JS library
- Features
	1. Designed to facilitate interactive data visualization
	1. Designed to work with DOM and associate HTML element with data
		- Adds data to the webpage
		- Treats DOM as a 'database'
	1. Designed to associate each data item with a unique element in the web page
- D3 merges DOM with a second database, which is the data to be visualized
	- Operator `.data(data_array)` binds an array of data to an array of elements in DOM
	- Operator `d3.selectAll(query)` results in a database query of the HTML document
	- Combinations of the above 2 allow D3 to bind a datum to each mark in a chart
		- Datum: individual data array value
		- Mark: HTML element
		- Chart: HTML document
- D3 methods often return the input container to support `chaining`
- Functions are objects and can be passed as params

## Join
- Joins
	1. Natural join == inner join
	1. Antijoins - values present in one database but not in the other
		- A $$\rhd$$ B means A - B, i.e. return the entries presented in A but not in B
- Methods
	1. `.select(query) / .selectAll` - produces query result
	1. `.data(data_array)` - adds data to be ready to join with query result
	1. `.attr()` or other update methods - natural (inner) join
	1. `.enter()` - access the extra items in data comparing to query result (antijoin)
		- i.e. data $$\rhd$$ query (presented in data but not in query)
	1. `.append()` - add additional items to query result
	1. `.exit()` - access the extra items in query result comparing to data (antijoin)
		- i.e. query $$\rhd$$ data

## Selection Methods
- Selection Methods
	- `d3.select(selector)`
	- `d3.selectAll(a).select(b)`
	- `d3.selectAll(s).filter(f)`
- Methods on selection result 
	- operate on each element of the selection
		- e.g. `d3.selectAll('rect').attr("width", 20)`
	- Modification methods
		1. `selection.attr`
		1. `selection.classed`
		1. `selection.style`
		1. `selection.text`
		1. `selection.html`
	- D3 selection helper
		1. `selection.each(f)`
- Best practices
	1. Merge pattern:
		```
		var join = d3.selectAll().data([]);
		join.enter().append().merge(join).attr();
		join.exit().remove();
		```
	1. Design to contain no elements that match the selection and then use `d3.selectAll('').data().enter().append().attr()`


# D3 Chart helpers

## Scales
- e.g.
```
var ys = d3.scaleLinear()
	.domain([0, 1])
	.range([500, 0]);
```
- Color scales: `.range(["blue", "orange"])`

## Axes
```
svg.append('g')
	.attr('transform', 'translate(' + MARGIN + ',' + MARGIN + ')')
	.call(d3.axisLeft(ys)
		.tickFormat(d3.format("~s")))
```

## Pie-chart
- `d3.arc()`
- `d3.pie()` returns a function that maps data values to arc angles
- Pattern: 
```
svg.select(...)
	.data(pie([data]))
	.enter()
	.append('path')
		.attr('d', arc)
```

# Event-based programming

## Interactive Computing
- Computing that involves a user
- Dialog
	1. user speaks
	1. computer hears
	1. computer speaks
	1. user hears
- User interface design
	1. Task analysis
		- Steps
			1. Study the way a person performs the task
			1. Decompose the task into individual user steps
			1. Results in a set of basic actions that may be shared among multiple tasks
	1. Dialog design
		- Steps
			1. Determine how the user and computer will interact / communicate
			1. Choose display elements
			1. Choose UI widgets

## MVC
1. Model
	- Application
		- e.g. Database
	- Can notify and update the view
1. View
	- display
1. Controller 
	- Input device and the system of controlling message passing
	- Initiates model and view actions
	- Responsible for handling (processing) user inputs as events
		- e.g. After certain triggers including click, the controller would capture this as events and then notify model

## Event callback
- For example, `submit()` callback function will be registered for certain events and later triggered once receiving the event. e.g. when the button is clicked 
```
<button onclick="submit()">Submit</button>
```


## JS Execution
- Single threaded (DOM is not thread safe) event based
	- in an infinite loop waiting for events to come in
- The call stack (code) gets executed first, and then any event from the event queue gets processed
- Ways to avoid busy waiting on resource loading
	1. Embed callback function to be executed upon finishing loading
		- Problem: too many callbacks
	1. `d3.csv()` returns a Promise object
		- Code is run when Promise is constructed
		- `then()` clause to execute after Promise is completed
		- Problem: still looks ugly if nested `then()`
	1. To wait on a resource to be loaded, use `async function() {}` and `await` together
		- While awating, JS event loop can handle other events


# Interactive & Dynamic Web Pages

## Web page interaction design (specific for web)
1. Task analysis
	- Steps
		1. Study the way a person performs the task
		1. Decompose the task into individual user steps
		1. Define set of actions used to perform the steps
		1. Same actions may be used in different combinations and different orders for different tasks
1. Dialog design
	- Steps
		1. Determine who initiates the dialog (user / system)
		1. Connect actions to interface elements
			- widget
			- event
			- display acknowledgement

## D3 Event Processing
- D3 event processor: `selection.on(event,listener)`
	- Event: string event type e.g. "click" / "mouseover"
	- Listener: callback function triggered by event:
	```
	function(datum, index, group) {
		this; // is a pointer to current node (in group) 
		d3.event; // current event
	}
	```
- Demonstrating showing tooltip as well as getting coordinate from event
```
<div name=“tooltip” opacity=0></div> 
<script>
d3.selectAll(“rect”).data(d).enter().append(“rect”)
	.on("mouseover", function(d,i) {
		tooltip.style("opacity", 1)
			.style("left",(d3.event.pageX)+"px")
			.style("top",(d3.event.pageY)+"px")
			.html("Item #"+i+" is "+d);
	})
```

## Tooltips
- `Affordance` - hints in the appearance of an object that imply the object's function
	- e.g. button appears raised to users clues that the button can be pressed 
- Need to allow users to not click very pricisely on a specific point to bring up the tooltip. How to achieve this?
	- A Voronoi cell is all of the points closer to that data point than any other data point
		- Similar to neighbour
		- As long as the cursor is within the voronoi cell, we can bring up the tooltip

## D3 Graph
- `d3.append('g')`
	- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/g

### Force directed layout
- Barnes-Hut approximation takes groups of nodes that are further away and treats them as a single atom.
- e.g.
```
var simulation = d3.forceSimulation()
	.force("link", d3.forceLink().distance(75)
		.id(function(d){ return d.value;})) // spring force
	.force("charge", d3.forceManyBody().strength(-100))  // prevent overlapping force
	.force("center", d3.forceCenter(width / 2, height / 2)); // keeps graph towards middle of display

var nodes = {
	{"value":4},
	{"value":8}
};

simulation.nodes(nodes);

var links = [{"source": 8, "target": 4}];

simulation.force("link").links(links);
```

### Dynamic Update Graph
- Users can use `d3.drag()` to drag nodes from graphs and all the nodes would be updated dynamically

## D3 Transitions
- Dynamically updating the visualization based on data change / chart type change
	- Achieved by tick events (internal)
- Example
```
d3.selectAll().data(data).enter().append('')
	.attr('height', 0) // begin
	.transition().duration(3000) // 3000 ms
	.attr('height', 100) // end
```



# Narrative Structure
- Will learn from field of film making and other methods of storytelling
- Narrative visualization
	- Designing a story that viewers walk through in a visual manner
- Narrative structure includes
	1. how to set up your scenes
	1. how to walk somebody through those scenes
	1. how to allow someone to wander off into their own scenes
	1. how to communicate your story to them even if they do wander off.
- From film making, scenes are set up for storytelling

## Elements of the Visual Narrative
- Tells how to lay out an individual scene of a narrative visualization
- Elements
	1. Structure
		- How is the data presented in a way that makes sense to the user almost immediately
		- Primary goal of the visual structure of a scene
	 		- To help the viewer navigate the scene
		- Sample structure: title, explanation text, chart, more text.
	1. Highlight
		- Directing a user's attention in a scene
			- i.e. let user focus on a particular region
		- Samples: make certain area brighter, use arrows to point certain points, flash effects, use animation, use different colors 
	1. Transition
		- Keep the viewer from becoming disoriented while moving from one scene to another
		- Example Ways: use the same template / same set of colors / same pattern / same layout / same legends of chart


## Elements of Narrative Structure
- Tells how to order the scenes to tell a story
- Elements
	1. Ordering
		1. Linear
			- a defined sequence
				- analogy to video
			- features
				1. gives author almost full control over the presentation of the data
		1. User-directed
			- provides more options to the user
			- features
				1. users would still be somewhat constrained
				1. gives author a lot of control and ability to deliver the appropriate message
		1. Random-access
			- Allows user to go in any direction
			- Drill down hybrid structure (see below) typically allows random-access
	1. Interactivity
		1. Number of ways that user can manipulate visualization
		1. How the user learns to manipulate visualization
			- Affordance e.g. button appears to be different
	1. Messaging
		- can use that data to tell a story and you can control what story is being told in the way that you present the data to emphasize some aspect of the data
		- The messaging is how those lessons that you've learned are communicated to the user and how the user of your system could maybe learn that lesson

## Narrative Layouts
- Visual Ordering Genres
	1. Video
		- Functionality to pause and play
		- Most linear one
	1. Magazine
		- Functionality to allow user to choose between reading the text / checking the figures
		- Control to bounce back and forth
	1. Comic strip
		- the layouts of those frames implying a visual ordering of the scenes of the story that's being told.
	1. Flow chart
		- Visual clues for scenes and using arrows for transitions
	1. Slide show
		- Press arrows to see transitions across an ordering (e.g. time, space)
	1. Partitioned poster
		- Zoomable interface; user can look into a specific partition
		- Most reader driven
			- as it creates a structure that allows the viewer to work through its frames in an order determined by the viewer.
	1. Annotated chart
		- Charts with annotations


# Effective Structures for narrative visualization

## Narrative Spectrum
- Spectrum
	1. Author Driven (One end)
		- e.g. cinema, commercials
	1. Hybrid structures
		1. Martini glass
		1. Interactive slide show
		1. Drill down story
	1. Reader Driven (Another end)
		- e.g. Google, Tableau
- Attributes
	1. How message is conveyed?
		- Message-focused vs query-focused
	1. Forms of story
		- Linear vs free form
	1. How story is driven
		- Non-interactive vs interactive

### Martini Glass
- Rotated martini glass
	- The narrow part is the author driven content
	- The wider part is the reader driven content
		- e.g. highlighting, filtering, path-choosing
- Can be seen as a slide show followed by free-form exploration
- e.g.
	- House renting websites

### Interactive Slideshow
- Users can navigate between slides and do more interaction with a particular slide if interested

### Drill down story
- Can look into the charts and find more details into other scenes
- Quite similar to interactive slideshow. Difference:
	- Interactive slideshow only provides drill down opportunity at a particular slide
		- Messaging is a bit stronger
	- Drill down provides an overview and drill down opportunities
		- More free-form 



# Creating a Narrative Visualization

## Model for Narrative Visualization
1. Scenes
	- Best practices
		1. should follow a template to keep the viewer oriented through transitions
		1. should follow a template to promote a consistent visual structure
	- analogy a particular slide in presentation
	- typically a single chart
1. Annotations
	- the messaging been drawing out a certain aspect of the data in each scene
		- Promotes `highlighting` from visual narrative
	- The annotations could be cleared between scenes, but they can also be built up in a sequence towards a conclusion
	- Best practices
		1. use to convey an author's message
		1. should follow a template to promote a consistent visual structure
		1. use to highlight interesting data points in a scene
	- e.g. annotations on a particular point of interest in a chart
1. Parameters
	- the parameters that are the variables used for the narrative visualization / creating charts
	- If certain parameter changes caused other parameters to change, a state machine is formed
	- e.g. slide number, current state of the visualization
1. Triggers
	- triggers that are the actions that occur as a result of various interactions / transitions of the scenes.
	- can be callback functions
	- e.g. if the slide number is x, then change certain variables

## Tableau narrative visualization
- In tableau, narrative visualization is called a story.




# Declarative Visualization

## The grammar of graphics
- A book by Leland Wilkinson
	- Approached the specification of a graph of data as forming a sentence from a grammar
- Grammar of graphics
	- Chart
		1. Guide
			1. Axis
				1. Rule - line and tick marks
				1. Scale - min and max values, extent of the axes
				1. Label of axes
			1. Form
				1. Line - line of interest in the graph
					- e.g. line of best fit
				1. Label - annotation of the line
		1. Frame (what's the data being displayed)
			- variables
		1. Graph
			1. Points (e.g. dots & labels in a scatterplot)
				1. Symbol e.g. dot
				1. Label
			1. Contour (e.g. a colored density plot)
				1. Color		
- 7 basic components
	1. Data
		- assigning variable names to the data in data source
	1. Transformation
		- e.g. sorting, figuring a rank of the variables
	1. Frame
		- defines what's being plotted
		- Format: `<var><op><var>` the operation is typically cross product
		- e.g. a scatterplot with x in x-axis and y in y-axis
	1. Coord
		- e.g. linear, polar
	1. Scale
		- coord transformation
		- e.g. linear, log
	1. Graph
		- specifies the points, lines, area chart, bar chart, etc
		- also aesthetics
	1. Guides
		- annotations e.g. labels on the axis and points

## Declarative Programming
- Imperative programming
	- e.g. `C`
	- Sequence of commands running from top to bottom
	- Each command changes the system state
		1. Initial state
		1. Some variables are placed on stack
		1. Stack variables change
		1. Function is returned, and stack is cleared
	- Order of commands matter
- Declarative Programming
	- Provides a spec on how the desired state of the system would look like
		- e.g. how a web page should look like
	- Order of commands matter less; less control flow 
	- Looks more like a database 
	- e.g. `html + CSS`
- How to enable interactivity?
	- using reactive programming - programming in response to events from e.g. data stream
		- i.e. generate callback functions to react to data from data (event) stream


# Declarative Visualization Languages
- d3 is also declarative

## Vega
- Features
	1. Declarative language for visualization
	1. Coding consists of high level spec
	1. Implementation: JSON with JS runtime
- Event handling
	- Declarative stream operations
- Examples
	- Embedding Vega in wikipedia with `<graph>`
- Constraints
	1. Vega can be quite lengthy for visualization

### Vega chart
```
<script src=".../vega.js"></script>
...
<script>
var chart_spec = {
	"$schema":"",
	"data": [{"":""}]
	...
};
vega.embed("#chart", chart_spec);
</script>
```


### Reactive Vega
- E-FRP: Even-Driven Functionally Reactive Programming
	- Values / states change only in response to discrete events
- Events would be processed as streams
	- A stream is a sequence of events of a type
- Reactive Vega uses a grammar to specify interactivity
	- Format: `{element}:{event}[{constraint}]`
	- e.g. Mouse over a rectangle `rect:mousemove`
	- e.g. describing a click on a rectangle whose associated data value X = 1: `rect:click[X == 1]`
- Event stream feature
	1. Concatenation - combine multiple event streams into a single stream
	1. Filtering based on event attributes
	1. Prefiltering: `[a, b] > c`
		- Creates a stream containing c events that occur between `a` and `b` events
			- i.e. ['a', 'c', 'b'] would not be filtered out
	1. Time interval filtering
		- `event-a{x, y}` creates a stream of events that occur between x and y interval
		- e.g. `mousemove{3ms, 5ms}`
- Signal
	- Variables that change value based on events
	- Supports parameters and triggers
	- ```
	"signals": [{
		"name": "x",
		"value": {},
		"on": [{"events":stream, "update":"{}"}]
	}]
	```


### Vega-Lite
- Backing points
	- A compact description of user selected data items
	- Stores the selection without storing all datapoints
		- If a range of data items are selected, the backing points can just be the first and last data items of the selected range.
			- The first and last items are sufficient to locate the range
		- Can also be represented by single data point / predicate (boolean) function 


## Ellipsis
- A declarative DSL (domain specific language) for specifying narrative data visualization
	- DSL
		- 'Little' language with few high level commands
		- Focused specifically on narrative visualization
- Based on JS
- Example
```
var vis = el.vis('my-visualization')
	.data(data)
	.stage() // SVG component
	.state() // parameters
```
- Grammar
	1. Scenes (parameter settings, annotation instances, UI control)
	1. Annotation templates (enter(), transition(), exit())
	1. Parameters (constants, vars, functions)
	1. Triggers (parameters, timer, event)
