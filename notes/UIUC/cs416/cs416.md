# Data Wrangling

## Data Preprocessing

### Data cleaning
- CSV: comma separated value. Quotes / commas are used to separate each fields
	- First line consists of field names
- Measures:
	- Values, either quatitative or qualitative, over dimensions such as time, country
- Indicator
	- The meaning / fact / name of the measures
- In Tableau, we can hide / filter data to get the data we want

### Pivoting
- In tableau, 2 options to display population over year
	1. We can put measure values as the column and measure names as the row to display a 2-D diagram of the measure
	1. Pivoting: in dataset page, we can drag all columns (as the row) and select `pivot`, which does a transpose of the data from the columns to the row
- Pivoting reshapes the data to make it easier for query and visualization

### Table Joining
- Inner join: the union would result in records that have entries presented in both tables
- Left join: the union would be inner join + any other left table entries
- Right join: the union would be inner join + any other right table entries
- Outer join: the union would be all records from both tables


# Data Aggregation
- Aggregation: Projections of measurements across one or more dimensions
	- way to combine measurements into a simpler form
	- typically reduces dimensions
- Quantitative
	- e.g. sum, mean, median, min, max, variance
	- Count: converts ordinal / nominal data into quantitative data
- Binning: discretizes quantitative data into ordinal / nominal data
	- from continuous to discrete
	- e.g. `pandas.cut`

# VisQL

## Polaris
- Designed to improve the UI into the data
- Built on pivot tables, user selected rows and columns
