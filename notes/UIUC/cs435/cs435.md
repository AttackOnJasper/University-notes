# Intro
- Goal of the course: provide you with a foundational view of communication networks with a focus on networks enabling modern cloud computing
- Parts
	1. Introduction of networking
		- Layered architecture
	1. Modern cloud network

## What is the Internet 
1. A collection of people and services that are all connected together
	- 50% of humanity connected
	- hundreds of millions of sites on the internet, with billions of requests daily
1. A set of protocols built on top of one another to enable communication
	- **Protocol**: a set of rules for parties to interact to achieve some sort of goal. 
	- Network protocols that make up the internet are often **event-based**.
		- An event would be a message sent or received and the protocol will define the content and format of those messages and what they mean, the actions that should be associated with a message being sent or arriving.
		- Rules are formalized
	- No single protocol that accomplishes everything we want to do; instead, there are multiple simpler building block protocols that allow us to achieve higher level functionality 
	- A network protocol defines a service interface so that other software modules can utilize the protocol in a certain way
1. A network of networks
	- Thousands of autonomous systems
		- 61,280 as of Aug 2018
		- Each has an AS number	
1. Millions of network devices and links providing connectivity
	- e.g. switches, routers, firewalls, load balancers
