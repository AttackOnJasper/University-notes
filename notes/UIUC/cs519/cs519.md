# What's Scientific Visualization

## Disambiguate 
- Data visualization: the techniques used to communicate data or information by encoding it as visual objects
- Information visualization: a process of transforming data and information that are not inherently spatial into a visual form
	- The layout wouldn't be natural (e.g. would not have order in time / space)
- Scientific visualization: using visualization techniques to convey information about data that does have some natural spatial component to it
- Visual analytics: science of analytical reasoning faciliated by interactive visual interfaces

## Topics
1. Terrain visualization
1. Volume visualization (spatial e.g. core of an object)
1. Isosurface
	- e.g. MRI data
1. Flow visualization
1. Tensor field visualization
	- Going towards all directions
	- e.g. Diffusion tensor MRI
1. Bioinformatics visualization

## Why visualization
1. Help other people carry out tasks more effectively
	- What tasks?
		- Reveal patterns and generate hypotheses
		- Explore data and make decisions / answer questions
1. Communicate ideas and persuade / inspire

- Visualization can be misleading  
- Shouldn't use visualization when it's not needed (i.e. better done without visualization / self-explanatory)
	- Can do does not mean need to


# Representing Colors

## Digital Images
- Raster: grid of addressable image elements called pixels
- Pixel: the smallest addressable element in that raster
	- i.e. can specify one color on a pixel
- Display techs
	1. LCD: Liquid Crystal Display 
		- A transmissive technology that uses light-emitting diodes as a backlight or edge light. That light gets filtered through a substrate to produce the colors that you see
		- Multiple layers. Starting from backlight and then filtered to RGB
	1. OLED: Organic light emitting diode
		- Different type of diode
	 	- Don't need backlight, the diode is emissive
	 		- use mix of blue / orange-yellow OLED emitters
 		- Features
 			1. Deep black levels
 			1. Excellent viewing angles
 			1. Fast refresh
 			1. Can potentially be manufactored on flexible substrates
