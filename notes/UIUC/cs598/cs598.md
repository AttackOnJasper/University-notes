# Week 1
- Data Curation
	- the active and on-going management of data through its lifecycle of interest and usefulness to scholarship, science, and education
- curation activities and policies enable data discovery and retrieval, maintain data quality and add value, and provide for re-use over time
- Data science can be thought of dividing into two areas
	1. Data curation
		- Ensure data is available, reliable, and usable
	1. Data analytics

## What is Data Science

		- data scientists play active roles in four related areas
			1. data architecture
			1. data acquisition
			1. data analysis 
			1. data archiving

		- the science of planning for acquisition, management, analysis of, inference and discovery from data
	1. Our definition
		- Data science is concerned with all aspects of the creation, management analysis and communication of data focusing particularly on the application of computational methods to digital data
- Goal: extracting useful knowledge from data

## What is Data Curation
- Definition
	- data curation is the active and ongoing management of data through its lifecycle of interest and usefulness to scholarship, science, and education.
- Curation activities enable data discovery and retrieval, maintain quality, add value, and provide for re-use over time.

# Week 2: Relations


# Week 3: Tree and XML
- XML
	- Typically implements the tree model, which can be used to 
		1. store text data
		1. seralize data stored natively in other data models (i.e. interchange, import, and preservation) 

# Week 4: Ontologies
