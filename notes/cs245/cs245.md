# CS245 Logic and Computation

## Propositional Logic
### Logic
- **Definition** the systematic study of the principles of valid reasoning and inference
- Why bother?
	1. Help modeling hardware, software, and embedded systems by reasoning them in a mathematically correct manner
	1. Understand how to develop systems that can apply reasoning themselves (AI)
- A logic is formalized by
	1. Syntax - the statement expression
	1. Semantics - meaning of the statement
	1. Proof procedure - how to prove a statement is true?
- Symbolic logic
	- use symbols to state propositions and build argument
		- i.e. each symbol is a proposition

### Proposition
- **Definition** a declarative sentence that is either true or false 
	- can be thought of a boolean operation
- Types
	1. atomic: single proposition
	1. compound: combination of atomic propositions

### formula
- Propositions are represented by formulas
- Formula components
	1. Propositional variables (lower case symbols)
	1. connectives: $$ \neg\vee\wedge $$
	1. punctuation: `()`
- Each formula is a sequence of symbols, but not all sequences of symbols are formulas
	- A finite sequence of symbols is called an **expression** (or a string)
		- e.g. $$ \neg q\vee\wedge $$ is an expression, but it's not a formula
- Definition of formula is **inductive**:
	- Let P be a set of proposition symbols. We define the set of formulas over P inductively as follows.
		1. An expression consisting of a single symbol p of P is a formula.
		1. If A is a formula, then (¬A) is a formula.
		1. If A is a formula, B is a formula, and $$s\in\{\vee,\wedge,\rightarrow\}$$, then (A s B) is a formula.
		1. Nothing else is a formula
- Forms: atom, negation, conjunction, disjunction, implication

### Induction
- Simple Induction
	- Shows P(k+1) holds for every P(k)
- Strong Induction
	- Assumes P(m) holds for every m <= k, prove P(k+1) holds
- Structural Induction
	- Proves that 
		1. property A holds for all atomic formula p
		1. if property A holds for formula P, then (¬A(P)) holds and (A(P) s A(Q)) $$s\in\{\vee,\wedge,\rightarrow\}$$ holds for any formula Q
	- Then A holds for any formulas
- W.l.o.g.: without loss of generality

### Semantics
- Interprets the well-formed formulas of logic
- Semantic of propositional logic is **compositional**
	- derived from individual parts
