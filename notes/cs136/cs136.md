## Elementary data structures & Abstract data types
- Abstract data types
	- only interested in certain operations without the need to understand how those operations are implemented
	- Definition: mathematical model for storing and accessing data through operations
	- Examples: stack, queue, sequence, dictionary, set
	- Making choices to implement an ADT:
		- Array would be a good choice if access elements at specific positions
		- Linked list would be a good choice if remove / add from front or back
		- Self balancing BST would be good for unsequenced data for search / remove / add

- Data structures
	- determines how data is arranged
	- data structures implement ADTs e.g. Java: List interface (ADT) is implemented by ArrayList and LinkedList

## Modularization (Separation of Concerns)
A **Module** is collection of functions that share a common aspect or purpose   
Why modularization?   
1. Re-usability   
2. Abstracton: only need to know what the function does instead of how it's implemented
3. Maintainability   

### Module interface
Interface vs implementation   
Pre-condition vs Post-condition   
Why interface?   
1. Abstration   
2. Information hiding (security and flexibility)   
Example: ADT is an interface whose implementations are hidden from clients 

### Cohesion and coupling
High cohesion means that all of the interface functions are related and working toward a "common goal"   
Low coupling means that there is little interaction between modules

## Imperative programming
- Control flow statements: change the flow of a program by changing the program location somewhere else than the next statement
- Side effect happens when an expression or function does more than produces a value (changes the state of a program) 
	- Pure functional language does not have side effects
- Instead of always producing new values in functional programming, imperative programming is a sequence of **statements** that instruct the computer what to do.
- State manipulation
	- **state** refers to the value of data at a moment in a time
	- mutation happens when state is changed
- C language
	- Identifiers: [a-z A-z][0-9 a-z A-z _]*
	- output: placeholders, escape characters

## Memory management
### Basics
- A bit is in one of 2 states: 0 and 1; 1 byte = 8 bits 
- 1 MB = 1024KB = $$1024^2$$ bytes
- Primary memory (RAM) vs secondary storage
- Smallest accessible unit of memory is a byte
- Need to know the address of a byte in order to access it from the memory

### Sections of memory
- 5 blocks: code, read-only data (constants), global data, heap (dynamic memory e.g. new), stack (track on execution)
- Sections are combined into memory segments; **Segmentation fault** occurs when try to access memory outside a segment
- Compiling: converting source code into machine code

### Heap
- Allocation / deallocation
- Memory leak happens when the allocated memory is not freed
- **Garbage collector** detects when memory is no longer in use and automatically retunrs the memory to the heap. 

## Algorithm design
### Criteria for comparing algorithms
- if it's easy to understand & implement
- robustness
- accuracy
- adaptability (applicable to similar issues)
- efficiency (time & space)

### Big O notation
- The runtime of a program is the worst case running time
- When loop counter changes geometrically, the runtime is often logarithmic (e.g. divide and conquer, binary search)
- Sorting algorithms: merge sort, insertion sort, quick sort
- Tail recursion is more space efficient

# Other C Notes
## Endianness
- The order in which bytes within a word of digital data are transmitted over a data communication medium or addressed in memory.
-  Types
	1. Big-endian
		- stores the most significant byte of a word at the smallest memory address
	1. Little-endian
		- stores the least significant byte at the smallest address
