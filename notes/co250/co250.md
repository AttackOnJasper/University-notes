## Intro
Real lief problem (Modelling) -> Mathematical formulation (Algorithm) -> Solution
### Linear program (method for modeling optimization problems)
- Actions & decisions encoded into variables
- Feasibility encoded as constraints
- Solution quality quantified as **linear** function of variables
- General form   
	obj $$ c_1x_1 + c_2x_2 + c_3x_3 + ... + c_nx_n $$  
	subject to $$ a_{1,1}x_1 + a_{1,2}x_2 + ... + a_{1,n}x_n $$ rel1 b1  
			   $$ a_{2,1}x_1 + a_{2,2}x_2 + ... + a_{2,n}x_n $$ rel2 b2 
- Feasible solution vs optimal solution
	- LP might not have either feasible or optimal solution

### Production Planning
- Several products, each products have different costs, limited resources. Goal: Maximize profit
- Correctness proof
	- is feasibility captured by linear constraints
	- is objective modelled properly by linear function e.g. Max profit

## Integer Problem
All values of variables are integers.  
**Mixed IP** Integer programs for which integrality condition is imposed on a subset of the variables

### Knapsack
Get MAX value of packages within a weight threshold and other constraints

### Shortest Path
- Graph terms: vertice, edge, path
- Decision variable $$x_e = \begin{cases} 1 &\text{if edge e is chosen in the path} \\  0 &\text{otherwise }
\end{cases}$$
- Objective function: $$min\sum_{e \in E}c_ex_e$$
- Cuts induced by vertex subsets
