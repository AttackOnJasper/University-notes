## Lecture 1 Introduction (2018-05-01)
### Course Outline
- Overall Picture of Internetworking
- Application Layer
- Transport Layer
- Network Layer (will be seperated into 4a and 4b)
- Data Link Layer & Local Area Networks

### Internet
- billions of connected devices (will go up to 25 bn in 2020)
- a global system of interconnected computer networks that use the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link devices worldwide.
- Analogy between data transfer in internet & product shipping
- Network edge: consumer of the network (host, end systems)
- Packet: need to break the data into smaller pieces, which are packets
    - Multiple paths for data transfer
    - **Packet Switch** make the routing decision about which path to choose for data to reach the destination (imagine transfer as a pipe, there is a bandwidth, or limit - constraint of the wire)
        - switches is part of access network, which is part of the edge
        - why there is bandwidth in wireless network? Many end systems; each only get a frequency band of the network
- Difference between router & switch
    - switch: located at local network
    - router: located at core of network (make routing decision based on IP addresses)

- **Service view**: Infrastructure (treat as blackbox) that provides services + API to applications
- **Elements view** 
    - Hosts: end systems (connected computing devices, including client, server)
        - sends packets of data
        - trasmission delay: L (length of packet)/R (transmission rate)
    - Links
    - Packet Switches: forward packets

### Socket Interface (analogy to post office during sending letters process)
- Provide the way to communicate between client & server
- Developers can choose the type of 'service' (e.g. guarantee delivery of message, speed of delivery)

### Protocols
- control sending / receiving of messages 
- define format, order of messages sent and received among network entities, and actions taken on message transmission, receipt (make sure everyone can understand each other)
- e.g. TCP, IP, HTTP
- HTTP clients: e.g. browser
- Internet standards
    - protocols will be reviewed by standards before released
    - RFC
    - IETF

### Network structures
- Network edge: hosts, data center
- Access networks
    - e.g. cellular network
- Communication links & Access (bandwidth, shared / dedicated)
    - DSL: connect network using a phone line (data -> internet; voice -> phone)
    - Cable: from home to ISP router 
    - **frequency division multiplexing**: different channels transmitted in different frequency bands
    - Ethernet
    - Wireless
        - Wifi
        - wide area wireless access: 3G, 4G, LTE
- Network core: routers, network of networks
    - collection of interconnected routers
    - key network core functions:
        - **routing**: determines source destination route taken by packets
        - **forwarding**: move packets from router’s input to appropriate router output
    - **Packet Switching** hosts break application-layer messages into packets
        - forward packets from one router to next
        - each packet transmitted at full link capacity
        - **store and forward** entire packet must arrive at router before it can be transmitted on next link
        - allows more users to use the network
    - **Circuit Switching** 
        - end-end resources allocated to, reserved for “call” between source & dest

### Delay, Loss, and throughput in networks
- Nodal delay = nodal processing + queuing delay + transmission delay + propagation delay



## Lecture 2 Application Layer
### Application architectures
- Client-server
    - server: always-on host, permenant IP address
    - client: connect with server by protocols
- P2P
    - arbitrary end systems direcly communicate
    - **self scalability** new peers bring new service capacity, as well as new service demands
- Processes communicating
    - **Process** program running within a host
    - **Client process** process that initiates communication
    - **Server process** process that waits to be contacted
    - P2P architecture has client process & server process as well
- Sockets (act as door)
    - send process: push message out of door (socket)
    - the other process receives the message at door (socket)
- Addressing processes: IP address
    - to receive messages, process must have identifier
    - identifier includes both IP address and port numbers
