<h1 id="psych-253-social-psychology">PSYCH 253 Social Psychology</h1>
<ul>
<li>the scientific study of how people think about, influence, and relate to one another</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="module-1-history">Module 1 History</h2>
<ul>
<li>Social Psychology Founder: Kurt Lewin (Germany -&gt; U.S.)</li>
<li>Gestalt psychology: the perception of objects
<ul>
<li>Lewin applied this to try to understand the perception of people</li>
</ul></li>
<li>3 parts of behavior (situation, perceiver, interaction)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="module-2-research-methods">Module 2 Research Methods</h2>
<ul>
<li>Try to revise theories over and over</li>
<li>To infer causation:
<ul>
<li>correlation
<ul>
<li>independent vars: control / experimental groups</li>
<li>dependent vars: measures
<ul>
<li>reliable (precise): get consistent results over and over again</li>
<li>valid (accuracy): measure what it is supposed to measure</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>time order</li>
<li>eliminate other possible causes
<ul>
<li>random assignment to each group</li>
<li>procedural control (keep process of groups as similar as possible)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Surveys
<ul>
<li>random sampling == random selection: everyone has the same chance to be selected (so that small group can represent the whole group)</li>
<li>unbiased questions
<ul>
<li>Anchoring effects: pushing people in 1 direction</li>
<li>Framing effects: framing questions to seem like there is only one answer</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>The ethics of experimentation
<ul>
<li>mundane realism: Degree to which an experiment is superficially similar to everyday situations.
<ul>
<li>a type of external validaty</li>
</ul></li>
<li>experimental realism: Degree to which an experiment absorbs and involves its participants
<ul>
<li>should engage the participants</li>
</ul></li>
<li>demand characteristics: Cues in an experiment that tell the participant what behavior is expected
<ul>
<li>To reduce this effect, experimenter standardize their instructions e.g. video taping</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Subsets: compliance, obedience, acceptance</li>
<li>The Sherif Study (1935)
<ul>
<li>Steady light in dark room -&gt; think it's moving due to autokinetic phenomenon -&gt; cannot tell if it's moving by comparing surrounding -&gt; people come to agree how far it's moved over several days</li>
<li>Transmission of beliefs: 5 generations (Jacobs and Campbell, 1961)</li>
<li><strong>Informational influence</strong> value others ideas</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Asch 'comparing lines' Study: would one agrees something wrong but other people saying it's right? (try to find out why people follow Hilter)
<ul>
<li>ask to take part in a study of perceptual judgments</li>
<li>unambigous stimuli; 7 confederates say opposite</li>
<li>37% subjects gave the wrong answer; 70% subjects gave wrong answer at least once</li>
<li><strong>Normative influence</strong> Conformity based on a person’s desire to fulfill others’ expectations, often to gain acceptance

<li><strong>Pluralistic ignorance</strong> A false impression of what most other people are thinking or feeling, or how they are responding.
<ul>
<li>a majority of group members privately reject a norm, but incorrectly assume that most others accept it, and therefore go along with it</li>
<li>in this case, it's difficult to read strangers' responses -&gt; hard to determine if it's emergency because other people have no behavior / signs (do not want to look like a fool - audience inhibition)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>

<li>3 kinds of information
<ul>
<li>Consistency: How consistent is the person’s behavior in this situation
<ul>
<li>not consistent -&gt; little attribution can be made</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Consensus: To what extent do others in this situation behave similarly
<ul>

</ul></li>
<li>Distinctiveness: How specific is the person’s behavior to this particular situation
<ul>
<li>it can be external or internal; need to be combined with other information</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-do-we-make-attributions">How Do We Make Attributions</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Representativeness Heuristic</strong> The tendency to presume, sometimes despite contrary odds, that someone or something belongs to a particular group if resembling (representing) a typical member.
<ul>
<li>e.g. Linda sounds like a feminist (has all traits of a typical feminist)</li>

</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Social Identity Theory
<ul>

<li>Aversive racism: people would not make overt prejudice comments
<ul>
<li>persistent avoidance of interaction with other racial and ethnic groups</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Inadmissable Evidence Study:
<ul>
<li>has inadmissable evidence that shows defendant is innocent</li>
<li>white defendant -&gt; people wanna prove he/she is innocent -&gt; ignore judge &amp; consider inadmissable evidence</li>
<li>black defendant -&gt; ignore the evidence -&gt; still guilty</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Subtler Forms of Prejudice - Recent Studies
<ul>
<li>The Amadou Diallo Story</li>
<li>Correll, Park, and Judd (2003) in video game, more likely to shoot black people</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Implicit and Explicit Stereotyping
<ul>

<ul>
<li>definition: The process by which a message induces change in beliefs, attitudes, or behaviors.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Classic Persuasion Variables</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="two-models-of-transferring-persuasive-messages">Two Models of Transferring Persuasive Messages</h3>
<ul>
<li>Controlled and Heuristic processing (Chaiken &amp; Eagley)
<ul>
<li>controlled processing: think about the image</li>
<li>heuristic processing: think without thinking</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Elaboration Likelihood Model (Petty &amp; Caciopo)
<ul>
<li>Central Route (thoughts): analytical, high effort, arguments
<ul>
<li>motivated to think due to the content / argument of message</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Peripheral Route (subconscious): focus on cues that trigger automatic acceptance</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-communicator">The Communicator</h3>
<ul>
<li>Credibility (usually peripheral)
<ul>
<li>Expertise (central) e.g. T.S. Eliot changed more people's opinions about bad poems than a local paper writer</li>
<li><strong>Trustworthiness</strong> Persuaded by people who we trust even if they have no expertise 妈妈让尝试一个东西</li>
<li><strong>Sleeper Effect</strong> delayed persuasion 慢慢洗脑
<ul>
<li>To have the effect, argument needs to be more memorable than the source (i.e. remember the content but forget who said it)</li>
<li>e.g. Oppenheimer (expert) vs. Pravda (local paper)
<ul>
<li>initially, most people must expert</li>
<li>with reminder of the source, not much attitude change</li>
<li>withou reminder, most people believe Pravda the same amount as Oppoenheimer over 4 weeks</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Attractiveness - Study: attractive / unattractive women ask to sign petition</li>
<li>Similarity</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-message">The Message</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Central Route to persuasion
<ul>
<li>If message has large discrepancy &amp; want it to be persuasive, then the argument better be good
<ul>
<li>Study: Ohio State students need to pass a 3-day comprehensive exam
<ul>
<li>high involvement people's attitudes largely depends on the arguments of the message</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>2-sided appeals &gt; 1-side appeal when processed centrally
<ul>
<li>Study: Yale school - strength of Japanese Army 1944; 2-sided speech
<ul>
<li>People who initially disagree the large strength of army think more centrally; have stronger argument</li>
<li>Result: 2-sided arguments work well on central route</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>argument strength: 质量大于数量</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The Peripheral Route to persuasion 无意识洗脑 e.g. TV ads
<ul>
<li>Emotions / mood

<h3 id="gourp-polarization">Gourp Polarization</h3>
<ul>
<li>definition: if groups discuss something, the opinions may become more extreme</li>
<li>Rishy shift: group more risky than individual</li>
<li>Study (Myers and Bishop 1970)
<ul>
<li>People with high / low prejudice about an issue discuss</li>
<li>after discussion high prejudice -&gt; more opposed, low prejudice -&gt; more supportive</li>
</ul></li>
<li>why it happens?
<ul>
<li>social comparison: want to look different if others have same ideas</li>
<li>more and more arguments push in directions further</li>
<li>Close-mindedness: one view shuts down other views</li>
<li>Pressures towards uniformity</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="group-think">Group think</h3>

<li>e.g. Bay of Pigs Fiasco (Kennedy send Cuba citizens to suicide), Pearl Harbour, spaceshuttle Challenger</li>
<li>Social conditions leading to Group Think: isolated, homegenous groups, directive leader</li>
<li>Tendency of decision-making groups to suppress dissent in the interest of group harmony</li>
<li>Symptoms:
<ul>
<li>overestimation of group's might and right</li>
<li>close-mindedness 有意见不敢说</li>
<li>pressure to uniformity (conformity pressure)</li>
<li>self-censorship: slient about concerns (since disagreements are uncomfortable)</li>
<li>illusion of unanimity</li>
<li>mindguard</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="effect-of-groups-on-performance">Effect of groups on performance</h3>
<ul>
<li>Social facilitation: other people around -&gt; better / worse performance, why?
<ul>
<li>Study (Triplett, 1898): boys reeled faster with audience</li>
<li>Zajonc's explanation: under audience, people perform better in easy tasks &amp; worse in hard tasks
<ul>
<li>study: cockraches with / without mirror run a mage</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Evaluation apprehension</li>
<li>Distraction - conflict</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Social loafing: slack off in groups unless individual input can be monitored / recognized</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="module-17-romantic-relationship">Module 17 Romantic Relationship</h2>
<h3 id="dating">Dating</h3>
<ul>
<li>Study (Festinger, Schacter, and Back): closer in geolocation (proximity) -&gt; Better friend relationship
<ul>
<li>Power of situation</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Mere exposure phenomenon</strong> expose more -&gt; like more</li>
<li>Physical attractiveness
<ul>
<li>Computer Dance I (Walster, Walster, and Berscheid 1966): Tell dancers that they are paired with people suited for them based on personality tests but actually randomly assigned
<ul>
<li>Result: whether people enjoy the dance depends on physical attractiveness of partners</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Computer Dance II: Let people choose the mate from 9 people
<ul>
<li><strong>Matching phenomenon</strong> The tendency for men and women to choose as partners those who are a “good match” in attractiveness and other traits 丑配丑，美配美 (high correlation)</li>
<li>Did not consider possibility of rejection</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Pick a date study (Berscheid and Dion) expected strong matching phenomenon, but rejection did not affect picking mate</li>
<li><strong>Physical-attractiveness stereotype</strong> beautiful people are good at other things as well</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Similarity and Liking (tend like people that are similar to us)

<h3 id="from-initiation-to-development">From initiation to development</h3>
<ul>
<li>Models of development
<ul>
<li>self-disclosure and self-penetration model
<ul>
<li>disclosure reciprocity: 你和我分享了你的秘密，我也想和你分享我的秘密</li>
<li>two people ideally should have the same amount of disclosure of self with each other at every time</li>
<li>A has less disclosure than B -&gt; B would wonder why A does not tell a lot of things about A</li>
<li>A has more disclosure than B -&gt; B would think it's wierd for A to tell too much stuff</li>
</ul></li>
<li>2-factor theory of emotion
<ul>
<li>early stage: all-consuming, passion &amp; love, arousal
<ul>

<li>e.g. suspension bridge study</li>
</ul></li>
<li>late stage: attribution - People like who they trust</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Attachments in relationship
<ul>
<li>Early attachment styles (secure - 自身安全感强，自信, avoidant - 不想太近, anxious-ambivalent - 没安全感，不敢付出) might define the later relationship attachment style</li>
<li>Everyone is better off with people with secure attachment style</li>
<li>New research shows 4th attachment style: depends on positive / negative views of self and other people</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Equity</strong> A condition in which the outcomes people receive from a relationship are proportional to what they contribute to it
<ul>
<li><strong>Long term equity</strong> give in response to partner's need without expecting anything in return</li>
<li><strong>Perceived equity</strong> feel whether two people are equal in the relationship (no overbenefit / underbenefit)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Illusions in relationship
<ul>
<li>Illusion promotes relationship</li>
<li>Study (Murray and Holmes, 1993):
<ul>
<li>Couples with / without conflicts under absence / presence of threat -&gt; test amount of rationalization</li>
<li>Low conflicts: low rationalization in no threat; high rationalization in high threat</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Study: self-esteem and illusions
<ul>
<li>high self-esteem people think the other loves them more; low SE -&gt; less</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Companionate love: compatibility, friendship, continuation of passinate love
<ul>
<li>even arranged marriages are happy in the long run</li>
