### Overview
What is machine learning
- field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed

3 learning categories
- Supervised learning (data with labels specifying the correctness of the data)
	- Given a traning set of pairs of examples (x, y)
	- Return a hypothesis function h(x) -> y
		- y is continuous -> regression e.g. housing prices
		- y is discrete -> classification (finite set e.g. {0, 1, 2})
	- Regression
		- Need to divide the data into training set and testing set s.t. the hypothesis can be generalized
		- Need to determine input
			- # of features (too many features -> overfit, hard to generalize; too few features -> underfit)
			- what kind of function to choose (e.g. linear, quadratic)
		- e.g. movie rating prediction
			- input: movie name, output: movie learning
	- Classification
		- Examples
			- ImageNet: put images into classes (deep convolutional neural networks)
			- Email spam filtering
- Unsupervised learning
	- Clustering
		- e.g. K-means
			- determine the # of clusters
			- choose random points based on the # of clusters predicted
			- Associate data points with center points in step
		- e.g. Autoencoders (artificial neural network)
- Reinforcement learning (not covered in this course)
